 Black Elk
###########

Black Elk (Heȟáka Sápa, 1863–1950) was an Oglala Lakota holy man,
healer, and visionary whose life spanned traumatic periods in Indigenous
North American history: forced displacement, the Wounded Knee Massacre
(1890), and aggressive cultural suppression. While Black Elk did not
write texts himself in the Western sense, his ethical and spiritual
teachings were preserved through collaboration with non-Native scholars.

Key works associated with Black Elk:

-  **Black Elk Speaks (1932):** (recorded by John G. Neihardt) A
   spiritual autobiography conveying Black Elk’s Great Vision and moral
   worldview.

-  **The Sacred Pipe (1953):** (recorded by Joseph Epes Brown): A
   focused exposition of Lakota ritual life and ethical principles.

 Storytellers
**************

Black Elk argues that the purpose of a storyteller is to **heal mental
and spiritual suffering**. In his teachings, story, song, and ceremony
are understood as forms of medicine. This makes the storyteller
comparable to a doctor: just as a physician treats physical illness, a
storyteller applies the appropriate measure of teaching and emotion to
help restore mental balance. For Black Elk, storytellers should not
merely numb people or help them forget their pain. Rather, it should
strengthen them, helping them recover clarity, resilience, and
direction. In this sense, stories offer insight that helps people live
more harmonious and meaningful lives within their community and the
world around them.

Black Elk also recognizes that those who speak or perform publicly
possess the power to arouse strong emotions such as fear, desire, and
anger, and therefore to move people toward action. When this
understanding is applied to modern contexts, it implies a significant
**moral responsibility**. Influence must not be used to exploit the
audience or the content of a story for personal gain. Instead, the
storyteller should aim to guide emotions toward restoration, helping to
rebalance individuals and, through them, society as a whole.

Black Elk further observes that the power of a speaker depends on the
**trust** people place in them. A voice carries far only because it is
supported by relationships. Trust, in his view, is established through
acts of service to the people. Extending this idea to the modern role of
the storyteller, when influence is exploited for personal gain rather
than service, trust erodes and authority weakens. In doing so, a person
undermines their own function as a storyteller, losing the very power
that allowed their voice to be heard.

A storyteller must also be **respectful of inherited stories**. When
stories are handed down, they carry teachings shaped and preserved
across generations. Such stories deserve reverence, and the storyteller
must take care not to introduce changes that risk breaking their
message. In this role, the storyteller functions as a preserver of
ancient wisdom. To transmit a story accurately is to honor those who
first carried its teachings. While this does not prohibit the creation
of new stories, it implies that inherited stories should not be altered
unless a new context genuinely serves the integrity of their message.

It is also important that stories provide a **truthful orientation to
reality**. A story may be symbolic, emotional, or ambiguous, yet it
should still help people align themselves with truth. Here, truth refers
not to literal accuracy but to a faithful representation of people’s
place in the world and their relationships with others. When false
messages are introduced, human relationships are harmed, as people begin
to rely on distorted understandings of reality. Over time, such
distortions spread through social networks and institutions, eventually
producing real harm. For this reason, the storyteller should avoid
propagating false messages, even when they are entertaining or popular.

**Humility** is therefore an essential trait for a storyteller. It
enables respect for inherited stories and commitment to truth. A humble
storyteller understands that they do not own the story; they transmit it
from ancestors to the community. Even when creating new stories, they
recognize that their authority is inherited, their insight shaped by the
world around them, and their influence sustained by a listening
community. The power to move others does not arise solely from personal
skill, but from relationships, shared history, and lived reality.

Stories must also be narrated in ways that never mock, denigrate, or
dehumanize people. In Black Elk’s worldview, every being carries a
"sacred center" and therefore deserves **dignity**. To dehumanize others
is to deny this truth and introduce a false moral message. The result is
an invitation to cruelty and the planting of seeds of division,
weakening social harmony and disrupting balance within the community.

A good storyteller also understands the value of silence. Silence allows
reflection and **promotes insight**. Rather than filling every gap or
resolving every question, the storyteller leaves space for the audience
to think, discover, and internalize meaning. An audience given time to
reflect is more likely to absorb and carry forward the message of the
story.

A good storyteller also chooses carefully when and how often to perform.
Applied to modern entertainment, storytelling creates habits of
attention. Ethical storytelling requires judging whether these habits
support or disrupt a harmonious life. A storyteller should **avoid
encouraging dependency**: situations in which people disengage from
life, community, or responsibility because they are consumed by
entertainment.

Finally, it is important that a storyteller **prepares intentionally for
performance**. Preparation here can be understood as a modern parallel
to ceremonial readiness. This includes reflecting on the content of the
performance, rehearsing thoughtfully, and considering time, place, and
setting. Care is taken to ensure that the environment supports listening
and understanding. The presence and emotional investment of the audience
are respected, and the experience is made worthy of their attention.
After performance, the storyteller reflects on the emotional and moral
effects and adjusts future work accordingly.

 Black Elk's ethical guidelines
********************************

-  **Serve your audience:** Define a purpose for your storytelling such
   as education, relief, healing, or connection. Avoid content designed
   solely to distract or numb; instead, leave audiences with something
   to carry forward. Ensure humor, drama, or spectacle restores balance,
   strengthens understanding, or communicates truth.

-  **Accept responsibility for emotional impact:** Anticipate how
   vulnerable audiences might receive your work. Avoid exploiting fear,
   shame, anger, or desire for effect or profit. Consider the potential
   consequences of stirring strong emotions. Treat interviews, social
   media posts, and off-stage remarks as part of your professional and
   ethical influence.

-  **Refuse entertainment that dehumanizes:** Reject stereotypes,
   scapegoating, or humiliation as shortcuts to attention. Be willing to
   lose opportunities rather than compromise human dignity. Decline
   projects that trivialize suffering, faith, or identity for novelty or
   spectacle.

-  **Respect silence as much as expression:** Know when not to comment
   or perform. Build pauses, stillness, and restraint into your work.
   Allow unresolved questions rather than forcing constant commentary or
   closure, giving audiences space for reflection and insight.

-  **Practice humility:** Credit collaborators, teachers, and traditions
   openly. Treat success as temporary stewardship rather than
   entitlement. Recognize that influence is sustained by trust and
   community.

-  **Use story and performance to restore balance:** Balance humor with
   compassion and critique with care. Counter excess, shock, or outrage
   with moments of grounding, perspective, and reflection. Avoid
   escalating intensity merely to maintain attention.

-  **Remember you stand within the Circle:** Stay connected to
   non-industry communities and ordinary life. Seek feedback from people
   outside your professional bubble.

-  **Tell the truth:** Be emotionally honest even when dramatizing,
   fictionalizing, or using symbolism. Do not distort reality in ways
   that encourage cynicism, despair, or moral confusion. Clarify
   intention when satire or irony could mislead audiences.

-  **Honor inherited stories and collective memory:** Treat stories
   handed down through generations with reverence. Preserve their core
   meaning and context, and avoid altering them in ways that weaken or
   distort their message. Create new stories freely, but do not exploit
   inherited ones for convenience or appeal.

-  **Avoid fostering dependency:** Be mindful of the habits your work
   encourages. Avoid creating excessive reliance on your presence or
   output. Ensure that engagement with your work supports, rather than
   displaces, people’s participation in community, responsibility, and
   everyday life.
