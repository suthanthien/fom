 Hippocrates
#############

Hippocrates of Kos (c. 460–370 BCE) is traditionally regarded as the
founder of Western medicine. He helped shift medicine away from
supernatural explanations and toward observation, rationality, and
professional discipline. Although scholars debate which writings he
personally authored, the body of texts known as the Hippocratic Corpus
is closely associated with his school and legacy.

Several works within Hippocratic Corpus are explicitly ethical:

-  **The Hippocratic Oath (4th century BCE):** The most famous ethical
   document in medical history. It outlines duties toward patients,
   teachers, and society; emphasizes non-maleficence; and prohibits
   harmful practices.

-  **The Physician (4th century BCE):** Discusses the ideal character,
   demeanor, and conduct of a physician.

-  **Decorum (4th century BCE):** Explores personal discipline,
   self-control, judgment, and the moral qualities a physician should
   cultivate.

-  **Precepts (4th century BCE):** Provides practical guidance on
   professional behavior, including fairness in fees and the ethical
   purpose of medical work.

 Doctors

The starting point of Hippocratic ethics is a functional argument: the
function of a doctor is to heal people within a society, and any
behavior that enables a doctor to fulfill this function well is
therefore a moral act. A good doctor aims to preserve life and health,
thereby enabling individuals to work, contribute, and participate in
social order.

To perform this healing function properly, a doctor must **treat all
patients fairly**, regardless of their social status or ability to pay.
Sickness does not discriminate, and neither should the physician because
a well-functioning society depends on the care and healing of all its
members. Hippocratic ethics recognizes generosity toward the poor as
both humane and good medical practice. Those unable to pay still require
treatment, and refusing them care contradicts the very mission of
medicine.

Hippocrates observes that patients are sick, vulnerable, and often
dependent on others. This **vulnerability** can tempt a physician to
exploit patients for personal gain. For this reason, it is imperative
that the doctor act solely for the benefit and health of the patient. An
unethical doctor is not only less effective in fulfilling the healing
function, but also damages the reputation of the medical profession as a
whole. As trust erodes, patients become reluctant to seek care or follow
medical advice, thereby diminishing the collective healing capacity of
physicians.

To perform the healing function well, a doctor must have access to
intimate details of a patient’s life: information that individuals would
often prefer to keep private. Such knowledge is essential for accurate
diagnosis and effective treatment, yet it must be handled with strict
discretion. A doctor must not abuse or disclose what is learned in the
course of care. If **confidentiality** is violated, future patients may
withhold crucial information, compromising the physician’s ability to
heal. Maintaining secrecy is therefore both a matter of personal virtue
and a structural condition of medicine itself.

************
 Do no harm
************

One of the central imperatives of Hippocratic ethics is the principle to
**“do no harm,”** whether through direct action or through negligence.
Medical intervention is legitimate only insofar as it supports nature in
restoring balance and health.

A doctor should never employ treatments or procedures known to cause
more harm than good, nor should they intentionally bring about death.
The physician must not administer poison, assist in suicide, or
otherwise become an agent of killing, even if requested.

Closely connected to this principle is the recognition of **professional
limits**. Medicine is a complex and demanding craft, and physicians must
not attempt procedures for which they lack sufficient knowledge or
experience. Acting beyond one’s competence is equivalent to endangering
life. A wise physician understands that mastery develops gradually and
that referring a patient to a more skilled colleague is an act of care.

A good doctor is also committed to **continuous learning** and
intellectual honesty. They strive to understand which practices have
proven effective and which have been shown to be harmful, refining their
judgment through study, experience, and attention to outcomes.

Finally, a doctor should cultivate a **virtuous lifestyle**: one that
promotes clear judgment, moral integrity, and precision in practice.
Personal discipline and ethical character enable the physician to make
wise decisions and act reliably in the care of patients.

*********************************
 Hippocrates' ethical guidelines
*********************************

This is a contemporary interpretation of Hippocrates' ethical
guidelines.

-  **Act for the well-being of the patient:** Prioritize patient welfare
   over convenience, financial incentives, or external pressures. Offer
   treatments with proven benefit, avoiding unnecessary or overly
   aggressive interventions. Discuss expected outcomes honestly so
   patients can make informed decisions.

-  **Avoid causing harm:** Evaluate risks and benefits of every
   procedure before proceeding. Follow evidence-based protocols to
   reduce preventable errors. Refrain from using untested treatments
   unless ethically justified and the patient is fully informed. Stop
   interventions that are doing more harm than good.

-  **Respect the limits of one’s expertise:** Refer to specialists
   whenever a case exceeds your training or experience. Be transparent
   with patients about your scope of practice. Engage in
   interdisciplinary collaboration for complex cases.

-  **Maintain confidentiality:** Never share patient information outside
   the care team except when legally and ethically required. Discuss
   cases privately, away from public settings. Protect digital and
   written records with secure systems. Ask for explicit permission
   before involving family members or others in discussions.

-  **Exhibit self-discipline and moral character:** Practice emotional
   regulation, remain calm and steady during crises. Develop habits of
   punctuality, attentiveness, and reliability. Reflect regularly on
   personal biases and how they may affect care.

-  **Show reverence toward teachers and mentors:** Credit your mentors
   when discussing approaches or skills you learned from them. Maintain
   a respectful, collaborative relationship with colleagues. Teach
   trainees generously, continuing the ethical lineage of medicine.
   Preserve and pass on professional standards.

-  **Treat all patients fairly:** Offer the same quality of care
   regardless of wealth, race, gender, or social status. Adjust fees or
   help patients access financial resources when needed.

-  **Uphold propriety and boundaries:** Maintain a professional
   appearance and demeanor appropriate to medical settings. Ensure the
   environment is respectful, clean, and suited for confidential care.

-  **Pursue lifelong learning:** Regularly attend courses, workshops,
   and conferences. Keep updated with current medical literature and new
   guidelines. Review difficult cases to identify areas for improvement.
   Seek feedback from colleagues and embrace a growth mindset.

-  **Serve society:** Contribute to public health efforts, education, or
   community medical programs. Advocate for policies that protect
   patient welfare and access to care. Provide clear, accurate health
   information to the public.
