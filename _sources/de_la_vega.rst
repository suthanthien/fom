 Garcilaso de la Vega
######################

Garcilaso de la Vega (1539–1616) was born in Cusco to an Inca noblewoman
and a Spanish conquistador. This dual heritage uniquely positioned him
as both an insider and interpreter of Inca civilization for European
readers. Educated in Spain after 1560, Garcilaso devoted his
intellectual life to preserving Andean history, culture, and moral
philosophy at a time when Indigenous traditions were rapidly being
erased.

His most influential work **Royal Commentaries of the Incas
(1609-1617)** is both an a historical chronicle and a moral and
political reflection on Inca governance, leadership, and ethics.

 Incan governance
##################

According to Incan political ethics as presented by Garcilaso de la
Vega, the fundamental role of the ruler is to provide for the people and
to preserve social order. The central moral principle organizing Incan
society is **reciprocity**: all members of the community receive support
from the collective and are therefore obligated to contribute to it.
This principle applies equally to rulers and subjects. While the people
owe labor, obedience, and loyalty to the Inca, the ruler, in turn, must
provide protection, material sustenance, and justice.

The ruler is expected to provide the following to society:

-  **Material security**: The ruler must ensure that the population has
   the means to sustain life. Labor contributed by the people supports
   the state, and the state reciprocates by redistributing goods,
   particularly in times of scarcity. Garcilaso emphasizes that hunger
   was regarded as a sign of political failure, as deprivation
   threatened social order and moral discipline. The ruler is therefore
   responsible for mitigating inequality and ensuring that even the most
   vulnerable members of society are not abandoned.

-  **Justice:** The ruler must uphold laws and enforce reciprocal
   obligations in a manner that preserves communal harmony. The ruler
   stood at the apex of judicial system, overseeing its proper
   functioning, confirming judgments in the most serious cases, and
   ensuring that laws were enforced impartially and without favoritism.

-  **Protection:** The ruler is responsible for the defense and care of
   the population, with particular attention to those unable to protect
   themselves. Garcilaso repeatedly highlights institutional support for
   orphans, widows, the sick, and the elderly. Although such individuals
   could not fully reciprocate through labor, their protection was
   considered a fundamental duty of the state and a measure of the
   society’s strength.

-  **Moral example:** The ruler is expected to embody the virtues
   demanded by the laws. Garcilaso consistently presents exemplary Incan
   rulers as disciplined, temperate, and obedient to the same norms
   imposed on their subjects. Authority is thus reinforced not only
   through command but through visible moral conduct, which encourages
   voluntary compliance and social cohesion.

To fulfill these responsibilities, the ruler must display certain
dispositions:

-  **Public visibility:** Garcilaso emphasizes the importance of visible
   authority expressed through ritual, ceremony, and predictable
   governance. Public ruler’s actions reinforced legitimacy and trust,
   whereas arbitrary or hidden behavior threatened social order.

-  **Respect for the natural and cosmic order:** The ruler understands
   and respects the broader cosmic order that governs both nature and
   society. Agricultural cycles and seasonal rhythms are part of this
   order and establish the natural limits of both people and the land.
   When rulers disregard these limits, whether through the exploitation
   of land or of the population, they invite imbalance, scarcity, and
   disorder.

-  **Humility:** Although the Incan ruler occupied a sacred and elevated
   position, Garcilaso emphasizes that this authority was not understood
   as personal supremacy but as a responsibility entrusted by ancestors
   and sanctioned by the divine and cosmic order. The ruler did not
   stand above the laws or the moral structure of society; rather, he
   was bound to embody and preserve it.

-  **Restraint:** Garcilaso insists that the ruler did not accumulate
   private riches, nor govern for personal ambition. Resources were held
   in the name of the state, and although the Incan ruler enjoyed
   symbolic and material privileges appropriate to his office, these
   were carefully regulated and publicly justified. Excess,
   self-indulgence, or arbitrary rule would have signaled moral failure.

 Incan ethical guidelines
##########################

Synthesizing Garcilaso’s normative account of Incan governance, the
following guidelines articulate the moral expectations placed upon
rulers within Incan ethical framework.

-  **Rule as a sacred duty:** Accept leadership as a responsibility
   entrusted by ancestors and the divine order.

-  **Provide for the material well-being of the community:** Ensure that
   the population has sufficient food, resources, and access to communal
   reserves. Respond to scarcity and prevent hunger.

-  **Practice reciprocity:** Match authority with concrete contributions
   to the community. Protect, sustain, and provide for the people.

-  **Place collective welfare above personal interest:** Make decisions
   that benefit the community as a whole. Avoid taking resources or
   privileges beyond what is necessary to fulfill one’s
   responsibilities.

-  **Lead by moral example:** Demonstrate discipline, moderation, and
   respect for the laws and customs of society. Conduct oneself
   according to the same standards expected of the people.

-  **Exercise justice consistently:** Apply laws impartially and
   predictably with the aim to restore social order. Ensure that
   officials act within established limits and that resources are not
   hoarded or misused. Guard against actions that threaten reciprocity
   or social cohesion.

-  **Protect the vulnerable:** Ensure the care of orphans, widows, the
   sick, and the elderly, who cannot fully repay assistance.

-  **Respect the natural order:** Make decisions in harmony with
   agricultural cycles, ritual obligations, and cosmic order. Avoid
   actions that disrupt ecological balance.

-  **Educate through law and custom:** Reinforce moral norms through
   laws, rituals, and public example to cultivate discipline,
   responsibility, and care for the community. Exercise authority in
   ways that are publicly intelligible through ritual, ceremony, and
   consistent practice. Avoid arbitrary or secretive actions.
