 Sun Tzu
#########

Sun Tzu was a Chinese military general, strategist, and philosopher
traditionally dated to the late Spring and Autumn period (c. 544–496
BCE). He is best known as the author of The Art of War, one of the most
influential works on military strategy in world history. Although Sun
Tzu is not an “ethicist” in the classical Western sense, his ideas
contain a clear and coherent ethical framework focused on leadership,
responsibility, and the moral limits of conflict.

Sun Tzu’s ethical views are found almost entirely in:

-  **The Art of War (500 BCE):** This text is not a moral treatise, but
   ethics are woven throughout its strategic principles. Sun Tzu
   addresses ethics indirectly through concepts such as righteous
   leadership, humane treatment of soldiers and civilians, proportional
   use of force, and the avoidance of unnecessary suffering.

 Rulers and governance
***********************

Sun Tzu presents rulers and generals as responsible for **maintaining a
stable and harmonious society, governing effectively, and preserving
authority**. These aspects are equivalent in practice, since each
depends on the other:

-  only a harmonious society can sustain a functioning economy, provide
   reliable taxation, and remain prepared to defend against external
   threats, thereby enabling a rulers and generals to retain power.

-  rulers and generals fulfill their role by managing affairs wisely,
   applying knowledge of diplomacy and warfare, and modeling disciplined
   conduct.

While Sun Tzu does not frame this guidance as a moral doctrine, his
emphasis on careful and restrained action can be considered **moral from
a Confucian perspective**, since it promotes social harmony and the
well-being of the people.

Sun Tzu observes that coercion of people is self-defeating. While it may
produce compliance in the short term, it erodes loyalty and morale over
time. People become exhausted and resentful, and lack the loyalty
required to support the ruler in critical situations. When circumstances
become high-stakes, discontented soldiers or subjects may rebel or fail
to cooperate, directly undermining the ruler’s capacity to govern. It is
therefore essential for the ruler to **provide for the population’s
needs**, maintain order, and act consistently and reliably, ensuring
that people can trust the ruler to uphold obligations and sustain the
stability of the state.

Consequently, a ruler must aim to **minimise the suffering** of the
people. One implication is that war should be regarded as a last resort.
A ruler ought to exhaust all other means of securing stability before
engaging in direct conflict, which inevitably entails loss of life and
the destruction of productive capacity and welfare. For Sun Tzu, the
most successful war is the one that is never fought: victory achieved
through diplomacy and strategy rather than violence. Treating enemies
with regard and transforming them into allies or stakeholders
contributes to lasting stability. Occupying a position of superior power
discourages aggression altogether.

A good ruler treats both people and soldiers with **humanity**. They are
not mere instruments of policy but integral components of the state,
whose collective existence sustains the ruler’s authority. They execute
the ruler’s will and defend social harmony, yet they are not to be
expended in capricious or ill-considered warfare. To them, the ruler
owes careful and informed decision-making, a sustained effort to avoid
unnecessary conflict and suffering, and treatment that recognises their
essential role in maintaining the stability of the state.

Sun Tzu argues that rulers and generals are responsible for the
consequences of their actions. It is imperative that they study ancient
wisdom and cultivate the knowledge required to **anticipate outcomes**
accurately. Failures arising from ignorance, poor judgment, or emotional
impulsiveness lead to military defeat and instability of the state. A
ruler must therefore never act out of anger, pride, or revenge. No
personal interest should take precedence over the preservation of
authority and social stability.

It is also essential that a ruler remain **trustworthy in their
dealings** with both the people and other states. While Sun Tzu famously
permits deception, he treats it strictly as a tactical manoeuvre
directed at specific military situations, not as a mode of governance or
a narrative to be imposed on society. Deception, like war itself, must
serve a precise strategic function and remain limited in scope and
duration. When a ruler extends deception beyond the battlefield, using
it arbitrarily, for personal interest, or to shape enduring narratives,
their credibility is compromised. Such practices erode loyalty at home
and weaken diplomacy abroad, as trust among people, allies, and even
enemies depends on the expectation of consistency.

******************************
 Sun Tzu's ethical guidelines
******************************

-  **Do not start a conflict without serious moral and political
   justification:** Exhaust all diplomatic, legal, and nonviolent
   options first. Clearly define what injustice or threat must be
   addressed. Ensure actions serve collective welfare. Reassess
   justification continuously as circumstances change.

-  **Judge success by long-term peace and stability:** Prioritize
   negotiation, deterrence, and strategic positioning. Use information
   and influence to resolve disputes early. Measure success by stability
   and harmony achieved.

-  **Protect the lives of people and soldiers:** Avoid unnecessary risk
   when planning operations. Provide proper training, equipment, and
   rest. Withdraw or adapt strategy when harm outweighs benefit.

-  **Avoid prolonged conflict:** Set clear objectives and exit
   strategies before engagement. Avoid actions that create endless
   retaliation cycles. End conflict decisively once objectives are met.

-  **Align your decision and people hearts and minds:** Act
   transparently and explain decisions clearly. Demonstrate fairness in
   rewards and punishments. Share both risks and benefits with those you
   lead. Regularly seek feedback and correct abuses of power.

-  **Treat allies and enemies with humanity:** Prohibit cruelty,
   humiliation, or revenge-based actions. Offer paths for reconciliation
   and reintegration. Set clear rules and expectations in advance.
   Balance accountability with care.

-  **Avoid unnecessary use of force:** Protect infrastructure critical
   to civilian life. Plan for recovery and rebuilding alongside conflict
   planning. Avoid actions that cause long-term ecological or economic
   harm.

-  **Develop skills in administration and politics:** Invest in
   learning, analysis, and foresight. Choose solutions that reduce
   confrontation. Anticipate consequences before acting. Reward
   thoughtful problem-solving over aggression.

-  **Use deception only as a tactical tool of war:** Maintain
   consistency and reliability in dealings with allies, troops, and
   enemies. Keep promises regarding rewards, duties, and obligations to
   soldiers and officials.

-  **Be an example of moral conduct:** Lead by example in discipline and
   conduct. Build trust through consistency and fairness. Recognize
   effort and loyalty openly. Create conditions where people follow
   willingly.
