 Conclusion
############

Across the thinkers examined in this chapter, despite differing
foundations, shared ethical elements emerge.

These thinkers generally agree on the principle that **greater power
entails greater responsibility**. Professionals possess skills and
knowledge that exceed those of most people, and they may apply these
abilities either for the benefit of society or for personal gain.
Professional ethics consistently calls for a commitment to the public
good, or, at minimum, a balanced position in which both societal
interests and personal interests are respected.

Almost all of the thinkers examined define care for others as the
primary purpose of the professional role, seeing ethical conduct as
grounded in fidelity to that purpose. Adam Smith is the notable
exception: he places self-interest at the center of professional
motivation and treats concern for others as a practical necessity,
necessary to sustain one’s own effectiveness and success. Despite this
difference, both perspectives converge on a shared conclusion: a
professional’s capacity to function depends on the **trust granted by
society.** Consequently, all agree that this trust must be respected and
actively maintained through careful, competent, and ethical service.

From this standpoint, **technical expertise** itself becomes a moral
virtue. Mastery of one’s craft, continuous practice, and ongoing
self-improvement lead to reliable performance and trustworthy service.
While good intentions matter, outcomes are equally fundamental.
Professionals therefore regard excellence in practice as a moral
obligation.

In striving for improvement, they also recognize their responsibility to
**sustain the profession** beyond their own careers. Aware that their
mission transcends their individual existence, they prepare others to
continue the work. Through teaching, mentoring, coaching, and the
sharing of knowledge, they contribute to a professional environment in
which successors can operate effectively and harmoniously.

 Virtues
*********

Thinkers commonly encourage the cultivation of the following virtues and
behaviours:

-  **Humility:** Even when your skills surpass those of many others, you
   remain fallible. Continue studying your craft, compare your work with
   that of your peers, and seek feedback for improvement. Honor the
   knowledge and professional standing inherited from predecessors.
   Remain worthy of the trust placed in you, upon which your practice
   depends.

-  **Kindness:** Treat those you serve with dignity, recognizing them as
   moral agents with legitimate interests. Never exploit, deceive, or
   harm. Support the professional growth and success of others. Learn
   from those who surpass you, and honor their achievements.

-  **Patience:** Do not allow anger or fear to cloud your judgment. When
   wronged, address misconduct openly and invite repentance rather than
   retaliating unethically. When outcomes fall short of expectations,
   document your experience, learn from mistakes, and reflect on how to
   improve.

-  **Diligence:** Practice your craft consistently, regularly review
   your work, and continuously seek improvement. Engage actively with
   your professional community to both learn and teach.

-  **Charity:** Be generous with your time, attention, and care toward
   those who are disadvantaged. Adjust fees or support others where
   circumstances allow. Never let financial reward tempt you into
   shortcuts or compromise the quality and reliability of your work

-  **Temperance:** Exercise moderation in your use of resources, time,
   and effort. Keep work simple and efficient, but do not compromise
   safety, quality, or the interests of those you serve.

-  **Chastity:** Maintain professional boundaries and decorum. Never
   exploit the vulnerable or those who trust you. Ensure your decisions
   are fair and impartial.

-  **Courage:** Uphold professional standards and ethical principles,
   even in the face of coercion or threats from those in positions of
   greater power.

-  **Integrity:** Teach your craft and ethical conduct by example, and
   follow the rules you expect others to respect.

 Sincerity
***********

Almost all of the thinkers examined agree on the central importance of
the virtue of sincerity:

-  **Sincerity:** remaining faithful to the true purpose of one’s
   profession and resisting the distortion of that purpose by external
   or purely instrumental motivations.

There is one notable exception to this shared emphasis: the ethical
thought of Adam Smith. Smith is unique in that he reverses the
relationship between professional role and self-interest. The other
thinkers share a tendency to ground ethical conduct in fidelity to
professional purpose and treat profit as a natural consequence of work
well performed. Although Smith does not deny the existence of moral
motivation such as sympathy, approval, or concern for propriety, he
takes self-interest as the primary driver of professional activity. In
his framework, professional moral conduct emerges as an instrument that
helps render self-interest sustainable and socially productive.

Unlike the other thinkers (Jonas is the only other exception), Smith did
not base his ethical account on firsthand experience of professional
practice; instead, he approached it from a systematic, philosophical
perspective. From this vantage point, he developed a comprehensive
account of how the wealth of nations is generated. Drawing on
Enlightenment principles of reason and an evolutionary understanding of
social processes, Smith portrays morality not as a starting point, but
as an emergent outcome of repeated interactions among self-interested
individuals.

This account is coherent, yet it does not undermine the claim hat
sincerity is central to the proper ethical functioning of a profession.
Even if sincerity arises historically from repeated interactions aimed
at securing a livelihood, it can nonetheless become internalized by a
community as a principle worthy of affirmation in its own right.
Sincerity encompasses several interrelated dimensions that, in many
respects, are already present in Adam Smith’s portrayal of sympathy and
concern for others: (1) the network of relationships that bind
individuals together; (2) the trust required to sustain those
relationships over time; (3) the aspiration toward purposes greater than
mere self-preservation; and (4) an awareness of one’s own desires
coupled with respect for the similar desires of others.

Smith demonstrates that self-interest need not be condemned or
suppressed by the state, since moral norms tend to emerge naturally from
social interaction. His argument thus functions as a justification, at
the level of political economy, for refraining from the imposition of
rigid ethical laws. Moral judgment is largely left to society itself,
which is expected to regulate conduct through shared norms and
expectations. Nonetheless, Smith does not deny that ethical conduct
pursued for its own sake is more effective and stable; this claim lies
outside the primary scope of his analysis. Indeed, Smith ultimately
acknowledges that unchecked self-interest can justify state intervention
in certain circumstances, leading him to examine when such intervention
is warranted and when it is not.

Therefore, although Adam Smith does not explicitly advocate sincerity as
a principle to be enforced through state-imposed ethical laws, he
nonetheless would agree that society would function more effectively
when sincerity is widely practiced and valued.
