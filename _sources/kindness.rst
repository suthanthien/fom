 Envy
******

Envy is the resentful awareness or distress caused by another's
possessions, qualities, status, or achievements, coupled with a desire
to deprive them of it or to have it for oneself. Unlike admiration,
which inspires growth, envy corrodes gratitude and fosters bitterness
toward others’ success or happiness.

Key Characteristics:

-  **Resentment:**: Feeling anger or bitterness at another’s good
   fortune.
-  **Comparison:**: Constantly measuring oneself against others in ways
   that foster dissatisfaction.
-  **Covetousness:**: Wanting what another has, not to possess it, but
   to see them without it.
-  **Bitterness:**: Holding onto a sense of unfairness or injustice
   regarding another’s advantage.
-  **Schadenfreude:**: Taking secret pleasure in the misfortunes of
   others.

 Invitation for the incontinent envious
****************************************

Some of these thoughts might lead you to believe envy is justified.
Here, there are some arguments for reflection and consideration.

-  **"They don’t deserve what they have."**. *Invitation:* Judging
   others’ worthiness often stems from limited understanding. Success
   and happiness come from complex factors beyond visible achievements.
   Focusing on deservingness wastes energy that could be directed toward
   personal growth and kindness.

-  **"I’ll never have what they do, so why bother?"** *Invitation:*
   Believing in permanent scarcity blocks motivation. Life is dynamic,
   and your own unique path can lead to fulfillment. Instead of
   resignation, use others’ success as inspiration to pursue your goals
   with patience and persistence.

-  **"If I can’t have it, they shouldn’t either."** *Invitation:*
   Wishing harm or loss on others only breeds negativity and isolates
   you socially. True strength comes from generosity and celebrating
   others, which builds supportive relationships and personal peace.

-  **"They must have gotten lucky or cheated."** *Invitation:*
   Attributing success solely to luck or unfairness oversimplifies
   reality and fosters bitterness. Instead, try to learn from others’
   journeys and focus on cultivating your own opportunities.

-  **"I’m entitled to feel this way because my situation is unfair."**
   *Invitation:* Acknowledging unfairness is valid, but dwelling on
   entitlement fosters resentment. Transforming awareness of unfairness
   into constructive action encourages resilience and empathy.

-  **"If I admit envy, I’ll seem weak or petty."** *Invitation:*
   Recognizing envy honestly is a sign of self-awareness, not weakness.
   It opens the door to personal growth and deeper kindness by
   addressing uncomfortable emotions directly.

 Reflections points for the continent envious
**********************************************

Take some time to reflect on the long term consequences of your choices.

-  Your envy poisons your ability to celebrate others’ joys and
   victories. This robs you of opportunities for genuine happiness
   shared in community. **Envy steals peace from your own heart first.**

-  Comparing yourself constantly to others feeds restlessness and
   dissatisfaction. It leaves you blind to your own gifts and progress,
   no matter how real they are. **Comparison is a trap that ensures you
   always feel “less,” even when you are enough.**

-  Your hidden resentment, if nurtured, can leak into your words and
   actions. This quietly pushes others away and breeds distrust in your
   relationships. **Envy breeds suspicion and fractures bonds that might
   have uplifted you.**

-  When you dwell on what others have, you neglect the cultivation of
   your own path. This leads to wasted energy and lost growth that could
   have been yours. **Attention given to envy is attention stolen from
   your true potential.**

-  Envy dulls gratitude, and without gratitude life feels perpetually
   unfair and bleak. This mindset traps you in bitterness, even when
   blessings are right in front of you. **Envy is scarcity, gratitude is
   abundance.**

 Reflection points for the envious
***********************************

These are not mere possibilities, they are common crossroads for those
who persist in justifying envy. If you do not change your relationship
with envy, these moments may find you.

-  **Sabotaging relationships with jealousy and suspicion:** Friends,
   partners, and colleagues will feel the sting of your comparisons.
   Over time, you may find yourself alone, with few willing to stand by
   your side. *Do not wait until loneliness is your only companion.*

   competitiveness that destroy teamwork and support. Doors will close
   due to fractured relationships. *Success rarely comes in isolation,
   and envy can burn the bridges you need.*

-  **Suffering from chronic stress and dissatisfaction:** The constant
   unrest envy brings can lead to anxiety, depression, and physical
   ailments. The price paid in wellbeing can be difficult to reverse.
   *Act now before envy steals not only your peace but your vitality.*

-  **Witnessing your personal growth stagnate:** Time spent envying
   others is time lost from pursuing your own dreams. When you look
   back, you may find how much you’ve sacrificed to fruitless
   resentment. *Do not wait until your potential is lost.*

-  **Corroding your joy until nothing satisfies:** Envy blinds you to
   what you already have. Soon, even your blessings feel small compared
   to others’. *If you do not change, happiness may always feel out of
   reach.*
