 Gandhi
########

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869–1948), popularly known as Mahatma
Gandhi, was a transformative leader, philosopher, and social reformer
who championed nonviolence and truth as guiding principles for both
personal and social life. While Gandhi is most renowned for leading
India’s struggle for independence from British colonial rule, he also
made profound contributions to ethics, emphasizing moral integrity,
social responsibility, and the power of truth in all spheres of life,
including communication.

Gandhi’s ethical thought was practical moral guidance, articulated
through essays, speeches, and editorial writing. His writings include:

-  **Indian Home Rule (1909)** a critique of modern civilization and
   moral decay;
-  **The Story of My Experiments with Truth (1927-1929):** a reflection
   on ethical self-discipline;
-  **Extensive writings in journals (1919-1947):** addressing truth,
   media responsibility, and public morality.

 Journalists
*************

Gandhi argues that the primary mission of the journalist is to **bring
truth to the people**. Society cannot function justly if its members
remain unaware of the realities that shape their lives. Truth fosters
trust, and trust is the moral bond that holds society together.

In Gandhi’s view, journalists wield significant power to shape public
understanding and influence collective action. This power carries a
**moral responsibility** and must never be abused for manipulation, or
personal gain. Ethical journalism, therefore, consists in serving
society through the disciplined and honest presentation of truth. In
particular, journalists must not exploit the poor or the marginalized,
whose vulnerability makes them especially susceptible to
misrepresentation. It is the journalist’s responsibility to portray
their realities clearly and respectfully, without turning suffering into
spectacle or advocacy into provocation.

Truth must be reported accurately and conveyed with **professional
skill** in a language that is accessible to ordinary people. Journalism
exists to inform and awaken public conscience, not to display rhetorical
superiority. Journalists must clearly distinguish between established
facts, interpretation, and commentary, to enable understanding and
clarity.

Gandhi observes that harmful speech breeds hatred, retaliation, and
social disorder. Journalism that inflames passions contributes to moral
violence and undermines peace. At the same time, treating injustice as a
routine or morally insignificant event is equally damaging. The Gandhian
alternative lies in **disciplined truth-telling**, where injustice is
revealed through careful context, human consequence, and factual
precision. These practices allows the truth itself to exert moral force
without provoking cruelty or vengeance. Respect for human dignity is
essential, as humiliation degrades both the victim and the perpetrator
and invites cruelty.

Gandhi also insists that truth must be pursued through **ethical
means**. A journalist who relies on deception, impersonation, or theft
undermines the very truth they seek to uncover. Dishonest methods erode
public trust and corrupt the moral character of the journalists. For
Gandhi, ends can never justify unethical means; information must be
obtained openly, with transparency about its intended use, and with
respect for the dignity of all involved.

Finally, Gandhi recognizes that journalists often face powerful
pressures that threaten their commitment to truth. He calls for
**courage** to serve the common good and to uphold truth even when
personal interests are at stake. Abandoning the pursuit of truth,
whether through fear, convenience, or compromise, weakens public trust
and diminishes the journalist’s role as a moral witness.

Only through integrity, restraint, and courage can journalism fulfill
its ethical function in society.

 Gandhi's ethical guidelines
*****************************

-  **Commit to truth:** Publish only what you sincerely believes to be
   true after careful verification. Avoid exaggeration, partial truths,
   and suppression of inconvenient facts. Distinguish clearly between
   fact, interpretation, and personal opinion.

-  **Practice nonviolence in thought, speech, and writing:** Use
   language that does not deliberately injure reputations, inflame
   passions, or provoke hatred. Avoid publishing material that may
   incite violence, communal hostility, or social unrest. Emphasize
   understanding, reconciliation, and shared human values.

-  **Adopt pure means:** Do not obtain news through falsehood,
   impersonation, or deceit. Accept that noble ends cannot justify
   unethical journalistic methods.

-  **Serve the public good:** Regard journalism as a form of public
   service. Place the welfare of society above personal fame, financial
   reward, or institutional pressure. Seek to enlighten public opinion.

-  **Take responsibility toward the weak and oppressed:** Give voice to
   the poor, the voiceless, and the socially marginalized. Avoid
   exploiting the suffering of individuals for public attention. Write
   with compassion and a sense of moral responsibility.

-  **Practice act of courage:** Speak the truth in spite of fear of
   authority, punishment, or public disapproval. Resist intimidation,
   censorship, or pressure from those in power.

-  **Practice self-restraint and discipline:** Practice moderation in
   tone, length, and emphasis. Avoid excessive emotional appeal and
   dramatic exaggeration. Control personal anger, pride, and desire for
   influence.

-  **Write with simplicity and clarity:** Write in clear, direct
   language accessible to ordinary readers. Avoid unnecessary
   ornamentation. Seek to clarify issues rather than impress. Respect
   the reader’s right to understand.

-  **Respect human dignity:** Treat every individual as a moral being
   deserving of respect. Avoid humiliation, ridicule, or deliberate
   injury to personal honor. Allow those accused or criticized the
   opportunity to respond. Uphold fairness even toward ideological
   opponents.

-  **Practice self-examination:** Regularly reflect on personal motives
   and moral conduct. Examine whether writing serves truth or personal
   ambition. Remain open to moral correction and ethical growth.
   Recognize journalism as a moral discipline requiring constant
   vigilance.
