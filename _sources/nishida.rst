 Nishida Kitarō
################

Nishida Kitarō (1870–1945) was one of Japan’s most influential
philosophers and the founder of the Kyoto School of philosophy. Trained
in Western philosophy but deeply rooted in Zen Buddhism and East Asian
thought, Nishida sought to construct a systematic philosophy that could
integrate logic, ethics, metaphysics, and lived experience. His work
aimed to overcome the dichotomy between subject and object, individual
and society, freedom and necessity.

Although Nishida is often remembered for his metaphysics of pure
experience and absolute nothingness, ethical and political questions
were central to his mature philosophy, especially the moral meaning of
action, responsibility, and historical life.

Nishida did not write an ethical treatise; nonetheless his ethical
reflection permeates his philosophical corpus. Key works relevant to
ethics and political responsibility include:

-  **An Inquiry into the Good (1911):** His earliest major work, where
   ethics is grounded in pure experience and the unity of knowing and
   acting.

-  **Intuition and Reflection in Self-Consciousness (1917):** Develops
   moral agency through self-awareness and reflective action.

-  **The Self-Consciousness of the Universal (1929):** Introduces a
   relational view of the self that anticipates ethical responsibility
   within social and historical contexts.

-  **The Problem of Japanese Culture (1938)** Addresses ethics, culture,
   and political life, including the moral role of the state.

-  **The Historical World (1939–1940):** Nishida’s most politically and
   ethically explicit work, examining the ethical meaning of historical
   action, leadership, and institutional responsibility.

-  **Late essays on the “logic of place” (1930s–1940s):** Provide the
   metaphysical foundation for his mature ethical and political thought.

 Political responsibility
**************************

Drawing on Nishida’s understanding of the historical world, the primary
responsibility of a lawmaker is to **articulate the ongoing historical
process** of society and enact concrete decisions that, in turn, shape
the historical process itself. Here, “articulate” is more than merely
communicating a message; it signifies actively deciding which aspects of
reality to highlight, prioritize, and act upon. Since lawmakers inherit
a social world shaped by past actions, institutions, and unresolved
tensions, their task is to understand current social realities,
recognize persistent suffering and instability, and take responsibility
for guiding society through the historical transitions they oversee.

In Nishida's view, even when a political decision is necessary and
defensible, it remains part of a longer sequence of actions whose
consequences continue to unfold. For this reason, lawmakers must act
with the awareness that their choices are provisional and incomplete.
Ethical governance requires **attentiveness to outcomes over time**,
readiness to revise earlier decisions, and willingness to address harms
that become visible only after action has been taken.

This stance reflects what Nishida describes as **self-negation**. A
lawmaker may act with conviction, but must do so without treating their
principles or judgments as final or self-justifying. To govern ethically
is to remain answerable to the historical world one’s actions help
shape. This includes assuming responsibility not only for one’s own
decisions, but also for the conditions inherited from previous
administrations. Taking office does not reset history; it places the
lawmaker inside it, accountable for its continuation.

Ethical political judgment, in this view, depends on **sustained
engagement with society**. Lawmakers must remain close to the lived
conditions of the people affected by their decisions, because the
meaning and impact of policy emerge only within concrete social
relationships. General rules and policy frameworks can guide action, but
they cannot substitute for situational judgment informed by ongoing
interaction with social realities.

Nishida maintains that lawmakers are not above society; they exist
within it, as part of a network of relationships, institutions, and
conflicts. They must act from within these relationships in a way that
**preserves continuity while enabling transformation**. From this
perspective, Nishida's ethics resembles Lindemann’s ethics of care.
Whereas Lindemann’s approach focuses on personal relationships, Nishida
applies a similar logic of care and relational responsibility to society
as a whole.

Political problems rarely present clean solutions. They are shaped by
persistent tensions, between individual needs and collective demands,
between freedom and constraint, between continuity and change. Nishida’s
philosophy suggests that responsible governance does not aim to
eliminate these contradictions, but to work within them. Lawmakers must
make decisions that **hold competing demands together** as best as
possible, accept that resolutions will be temporary, and remain prepared
to adjust their course as circumstances and relationships evolve.

*********
 Virtues
*********

Nishida does not develop a classical virtue ethics, and he does not
enumerate personal traits or moral habits. However, from his account of
historical action, relational selfhood, and self-negation, we can infer
a set of virtues that are valuable for ethical governance.

-  **Practical Wisdom:** Ethical lawmakers navigate complex and
   contradictory issues, adopt provisional solutions, and continuously
   reassess policies as historical and social circumstances evolve.

-  **Justice:** Ethical lawmakers attend to historical legacies, repair
   harms inherited from past governance, and adjust policies to maintain
   fairness and relational stability over time.

-  **Courage:** Ethical lawmakers take responsibility for intended and
   unintended consequences, act decisively under uncertainty, and
   undertake corrective action even when politically costly.

-  **Temperance:** Ethical lawmakers exercise restraint in the use of
   power, avoid overreach, and ensure that interventions are
   proportionate to social and historical realities.

-  **Humility (as Self-Negation):** Ethical lawmakers remain open to
   critique, acknowledge the limits of their understanding, and sustain
   ethical responsibility through ongoing engagement and revision.

******************************
 Nishida's ethical guidelines
******************************

The following guidelines are drawn directly from Nishida’s political
ethics

-  **Observe and understand lived realities:** Conduct regular site
   visits and community consultations. Gather first-hand information on
   social, economic, and cultural conditions. Identify the historical
   and relational context of affected communities.

-  **Acknowledge inherited responsibilities:** Review past laws,
   policies, and structural inequalities. Take responsibility for
   unresolved harms from previous administrations. Include remedies or
   compensation for past injustices in new policies.

-  **Use abstract rules as guides:** Refer to legal principles, expert
   guidelines, and frameworks. Test these rules against the concrete
   experiences of the community. Adapt or override rules when they
   conflict with lived realities.

-  **Maintain ongoing accountability:** Establish review processes for
   decisions after implementation. Publicly acknowledge mistakes and
   take corrective action. Report transparently to citizens about policy
   outcomes and limitations.

-  **Approach complex issues creatively:** Accept that some problems
   involve contradictions (e.g., individual vs. collective needs). Use
   temporary, adaptive solutions when definitive answers are impossible.
   Reassess and revise approaches as social and historical circumstances
   change.

-  **Stay open to critique and reflection:** Encourage constructive
   criticism from citizens, experts, and peers. Regularly reassess
   policies in light of new information or perspectives. Recognize the
   limits of one’s knowledge and moral certainty.
