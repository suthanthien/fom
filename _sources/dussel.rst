 Enrique Dussel
################

Enrique Domingo Dussel Peters (1934–2023) was an Argentine–Mexican
philosopher, historian, and theologian, widely regarded as one of the
founders of the Philosophy of Liberation. Born in La Paz, Argentina,
Dussel studied philosophy and theology in Argentina, Spain, France, and
Israel. After being forced into exile by the Argentine military
dictatorship in the 1970s, he settled in Mexico, where he spent most of
his academic career.

Dussel’s work focuses on ethics, political philosophy, and critique of
Eurocentrism, placing the experiences of oppressed and marginalized
peoples, especially in Latin America, at the center of philosophical
reflection.

Dussel developed his ethical thought over several decades. Some of his
most important ethical works include:

-  **Toward an Ethics of Latin American Liberation (1973–1980):** A
   multi-volume foundational project that introduces the ethical
   perspective of liberation rooted in Latin American realities.

-  **Communitarian Ethics (1986):** Explores ethics grounded in communal
   life rather than individualism.

-  **Ethics of Liberation in the Age of Globalization and Exclusion
   (1998):** His most systematic ethical work, addressing globalization,
   neoliberalism, and structural exclusion.

-  **Toward a Critical Political Philosophy (2001):** Extends ethical
   principles into political philosophy.

-  **Twenty Theses on Politics (2006):** Applies liberation ethics to
   concrete political practice.

 Centrality of life
********************

Dussel argues that ethics must begin from concrete, lived experience
rather than from abstract rules. He observes that traditions and moral
norms imposed on a society can themselves become **sources of
suffering**. Rules that appear just or reasonable to those in power may
harm those who live under them. When ethical standards are shaped within
a dominant social group, they often fail to reflect the reality of
people who are marginalized or excluded. Those who benefit from such
norms may not recognize the pain they cause, because their concerns are
formed within a different social position.

For Dussel, **ethics begins with the experience of those whose lives are
harmed or denied**. From this starting point, he proposes two basic
ethical criteria:

-  The function of norms, institutions, and traditions is to organize
   and sustain human life. If they harm or destroy life, they lose their
   ethical legitimacy.

-  The claims of those who suffer hunger, exploitation, or exclusion
   take priority over institutional or legal justifications. Such
   suffering reveals that the system is structured in a way that
   prevents certain people from living with dignity, and thus has failed
   in its fundamental ethical obligation.

Ethical responsibility therefore requires close attention to how
institutions actually affect those at the margins of society. This
demands **historical awareness and constant critique**. As social
conditions change, rules and institutions that once seemed just can
produce new forms of domination and create new victims. Ethics requires
remaining receptive to the challenges experienced by those who suffer.

In societies that rely on **participation and consensus**, Dussel
insists that agreement alone is never enough. A decision may be widely
accepted and still be unjust if it ignores or excludes those whose lives
are materially affected by it. When groups are structurally prevented
from participating, their suffering tends to be overlooked by economic
and political institutions. For Dussel, this is ethically unacceptable.
Wherever human life is harmed or reduced to a means, ethics demands
critique and change.

 Solidaristic courage
**********************

.. note::

   What follows does not reconstruct Dussel’s ethics directly, but
   offers an interpretive account of the subjective demands placed on
   agents who seek to act in fidelity to it.

While Dussel does not develop a virtue ethics, responding to his ethical
presupposes dispositions that can reasonably be understood as courage.

This courage includes not only confronting unjust institutions, but it
also involves turning **a critical eye on one’s own beliefs, traditions,
and social position**. It is the courage to recognize one’s possible
complicity in systems of domination and to accept the personal cost of
change. This may involve giving up comfort, security, or privilege, and
facing uncertainty about one’s own moral standing.

In Dussel's ethics, courage is expressed through **solidarity**. It
means standing alongside those who suffer, working with them, and
sharing in their risks. It requires proximity, participation, and a
willingness to let the experience of the oppressed reshape one’s
understanding of justice.

This form of courage offers no guarantees. It brings no recognition or
moral reassurance. Instead, it demands constant self-examination and
attentiveness to whether one’s actions truly serve those whose lives are
most threatened. It is the courage to **become accountable** to the
excluded and oppressed, and to risk social standing for the sake of
sustaining and protecting the life and dignity of all people in the
community.

*****************************
 Dussel's ethical guidelines
*****************************

-  **Put the Life of the Oppressed First:** Pay attention to who is most
   harmed by policies, decisions, or systems. In your work or community,
   ask: Who is excluded or suffering here? Support initiatives that
   directly improve basic living conditions (food, housing, healthcare).

-  **Listen to the Voice of the Victim:** Create spaces where
   marginalized voices can speak without fear. Practice active listening
   rather than speaking for others. Let testimonies of suffering
   challenge your assumptions and comfort.

-  **Reject Ethical Neutrality:** Identify situations where “business as
   usual” causes harm. Take a clear stance against injustice, even when
   it is inconvenient. Reflect on how your silence may reinforce
   oppression.

-  **Defend the Material Conditions of Life:** Support fair wages, labor
   rights, and access to essential resources. Evaluate economic choices
   (consumption, investment, employment) ethically. Advocate for social
   structures that protect life.

-  **Critically Question Dominant Norms and Institutions:** Do not
   assume legality equals morality. Ask how institutions benefit some
   while excluding others. Support reforms or alternatives when systems
   systematically harm people.

-  **Practice Solidarity:** Work with oppressed communities. Avoid
   actions that reinforce dependency or superiority. Commit to long-term
   relationships and collective action.

-  **Act Collectively:** Join organizations, movements, or unions that
   pursue justice. Support collective decision-making processes.

-  **Promote Dialogue from Below:** Encourage participatory
   decision-making in communities and institutions. Ensure that meetings
   and processes are accessible to all. Be willing to revise decisions
   when excluded voices are heard.

-  **Resist Global Systems of Exclusion:** Be aware of how global supply
   chains affect workers and environments. Support ethical trade, local
   economies, and ecological responsibility. Question narratives that
   justify exclusion in the name of “development.”

-  **Commit to Liberation:** Regularly reflect on your own complicity in
   unjust systems. Stay open to learning from new forms of oppression
   and resistance. Treat ethical commitment as a lifelong practice.
