 Cicero
########

Marcus Tullius Cicero (106–43 BCE) was a Roman statesman, lawyer,
orator, and philosopher, widely regarded as one of the greatest speakers
of antiquity. Living during the final decades of the Roman Republic,
Cicero was deeply involved in public life, serving as consul in 63 BCE
and playing a central role in Roman politics during a period of civil
conflict and moral decline.

Cicero did not consider philosophy a purely abstract pursuit. For him,
ethics was inseparable from politics: moral philosophy existed to guide
public life, preserve the republic, and shape virtuous leaders. He
adapted Greek philosophical traditions (especially Stoicism, and
elements of Platonism and Aristotelianism) to Roman political realities.

Cicero’s main contributions to ethics were written late in his life,
often during periods of political exile or withdrawal:

-  **On the Republic (54–51 BCE):** Explores justice, law, and the moral
   foundations of political authority.

-  **On the Laws (52–43 BCE):** Develops a theory of natural law as the
   ethical basis of legislation.

-  **On Duties (44 BCE):** Cicero’s most influential ethical work,
   written for his son. It explicitly addresses moral obligations in
   public and private life, especially for statesmen.

-  **On the Ends of Good and Evil (45 BCE):** Examines competing ethical
   systems and clarifies Cicero’s moral framework.

 Virtues and Duties
********************

Cicero begins his ethical discourse with a functional argument. The role
of a consul or statesman is, above all, the **service of the
community**. Rulers are entrusted with public office in order to
administer society, uphold the fairness of laws, maintain stability, and
promote the well-being of the population. A moral statesman is one who
consistently strives to fulfill this role. Acting from alternative
motives such as the pursuit of power, wealth, or personal gratification,
undermines the very purpose of political office and is therefore morally
deficient.

Cicero argues that rulers who fail to uphold virtuous conduct in
accordance with their duties gradually erode the trust people place in
their capacity to govern. Political authority relies in large part on
**public trust**, especially because citizens cannot always grasp the
full consequences of political decisions. When a ruler is perceived as
unjust or self-serving, obedience becomes reluctant. Although coercion
may temporarily preserve authority, Cicero warns that rule sustained
primarily through fear is unstable and corrosive. Over time, it weakens
civic bonds, increases resistance, and leaves the political order
vulnerable to internal fragmentation and external threats, conditions
under which even powerful rulers risk losing both legitimacy and office.

Cicero identifies several forms of virtuous conduct as essential to
statesmanship:

-  **Justice:** A statesman ensures fairness at all times. They do not
   favor their party, friends, or family, and they distribute resources
   equitably. They neither seek personal enrichment at the expense of
   others nor accept bribes or grant unjust advantages.

-  **Benevolence:** Justice alone is insufficient without a genuine
   disposition to benefit others. A statesman should actively promote
   the welfare of the community. Kindness, expressed through mercy,
   fairness in punishment, and concern for the vulnerable, strengthens
   loyalty and reinforces the moral legitimacy of authority.
   Nonetheless, such benevolence must remain impartial and guided by the
   common good.

-  **Integrity:** A statesman acts according to the same standards they
   expect others to follow. Discrepancies between public rules and
   private conduct undermine credibility and destroy the trust on which
   authority depends.

-  **Temperance:** A statesman exercises self-restraint and does not act
   out of impulse or uncontrolled desire. Without mastery over oneself,
   rational judgment becomes difficult precisely when decisions carry
   the greatest consequences. Self-control is therefore a defining
   condition of competent and trustworthy rule.

-  **Patience:** Closely related to temperance, patience enables a
   statesman to endure provocation, delay gratification, and deliberate
   calmly under pressure. Resistance to anger and rashness is essential
   for fair judgment and stable governance, particularly in moments of
   crisis.

-  **Practical wisdom:** A statesman must understand the political
   context, anticipate the likely outcomes of decisions, and select
   appropriate means of implementation. This includes careful
   consideration of how policies will affect different groups within
   society.

-  **Diligence:** Holding office entails active and sustained
   engagement. A statesman must attend carefully to public affairs,
   and carry out responsibilities conscientiously.

-  **Courage:** A statesman upholds justice even when doing so entails
   personal risk. For Cicero, the loss of honor is worse than the loss
   of life. Those entrusted with public office are expected to defend
   the integrity of that office even under threat. Failure in this
   regard not only renders rulers susceptible to corruption but also
   weakens public confidence in political institutions more broadly.

-  **Reliability:** A statesman recognizes that political authority
   involves exceptional responsibility. Their power can produce great
   benefit or great harm, and thus demands consistency of character,
   seriousness of purpose, and fidelity to public commitments. For
   Cicero, those who govern are held to a higher standard of virtue
   precisely because their actions shape the moral and political fabric
   of society.

 Cicero's ethical guidelines
*****************************

-  **Serve the common good:** Evaluate policies by their long-term
   impact on society as a whole. Resist pressure from donors or factions
   that benefit at public expense. Regularly consult diverse social
   groups.

-  **Uphold justice as the basis of authority:** Apply laws uniformly,
   regardless of status or political alignment. Ensure that punishments
   and rewards are proportionate and fair. Defend legal processes even
   when outcomes are personally unfavorable.

-  **Maintain integrity and honesty:** Speak truthfully in public
   communications. Communicate clearly about risks, trade-offs, and
   uncertainties. Admit mistakes openly and correct them promptly.
   Welcome scrutiny from the press, courts, and civil society.

-  **Reject corruption and greed:** Set clear limits on gifts, and
   hospitality. Support independent oversight and transparent financial
   reporting. Live modestly in a manner consistent with public service.

-  **Exercise moderation and self-control:** Avoid inflammatory rhetoric
   aimed at provoking fear or anger. Delay major decisions during
   moments of emotional intensity. Seek counsel from trusted advisors
   before acting under pressure.

-  **Practice practical wisdom:** Consider foreseeable consequences.
   Balance ideal solutions with institutional stability and social
   realities. Choose the least harmful option when no perfect solution
   exists.

-  **Protect the rule of law:** Respect constitutional limits on
   executive power. Oppose emergency measures that permanently weaken
   institutions. Defend judicial independence and due process.

-  **Respect property and civic rights:** Protect citizens from
   arbitrary seizure or discrimination. Ensure laws safeguard basic
   civil and economic freedoms. Compensate fairly when public necessity
   requires private sacrifice.

-  **Cultivate moral character and virtue:** Engage in regular
   self-examination and ethical reflection. Study moral philosophy,
   history, and exemplary leaders. Surround oneself with advisors who
   value truth.

-  **Show courage in defense of justice:** Defend ethical principles
   despite political or personal risk. Speak against injustice within
   one’s own party or administration. Accept loss of office rather than
   moral compromise.

-  **Promote civic harmony:** Seek compromise without sacrificing core
   principles. Avoid language that dehumanizes opponents. Support
   institutions that mediate conflict peacefully.
