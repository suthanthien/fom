 Magobe Ramose
###############

Mogobe Bernard Ramose (born 1947, South Africa) is a South African
philosopher best known for his work in African philosophy, particularly
the philosophy of Ubuntu. He is one of the most influential voices in
post-apartheid philosophical thought and has been instrumental in
developing and articulating an African-centered framework for ethics,
justice, and human dignity.

Ramose’s most significant ethical writings are found in his book:

-  **African Philosophy through Ubuntu (1999):** This work
   systematically develops Ubuntu as a philosophical system, addressing
   ontology, epistemology, and ethics.

-  Later essays, such as **The Ethics of Ubuntu (2003)** and
   **Globalization and Ubuntu (2002)**, expand on these themes by
   applying Ubuntu ethics to contemporary global and political contexts.

*********************
 Community wholeness
*********************

Ramose argues that the morality of an action depends on whether it
preserves or restores the wholeness of the community to which a person
belongs. In his Ubuntu philosophy, communal wholeness refers to a state
of **relational harmony** among all members of the community, including
the living, the ancestors, and future generations. It is characterized
by:

-  The recognition and affirmation of each person’s dignity;
-  Relationships that are balanced, reciprocal, and life-affirming;
-  A moral fabric in which no one is dehumanized, even when harm has
   occurred.

Ramose's ethics redefines Aristotle's ideas of flourishing in relational
terms: **a person exists and flourishes only through others**. From an
Aristotelian standpoint, Ramose’s reasoning can be interpreted as
follows:

-  A person exists as a person only through others; their existence and
   flourishing depend on the community to which they belong.

-  Just as an individual experiences cognitive dissonance when holding
   contradicting thoughts, so too a community experiences a kind of
   moral dissonance when one of its members harms it.

-  Because the community provides each person’s identity and meaning,
   harming the community is ultimately harming oneself.

-  Just as an individual seeks to restore inner coherence after
   dissonance, the community seeks to restore its wholeness when its
   harmony is disrupted.

-  Preserving wholeness is therefore part of the proper function of
   being human: an essential aspect of flourishing.

-  Consequently, any action that contributes to the preservation or
   restoration of communal wholeness is a moral act.

Although Ramose seldom draws direct comparisons, his ethics resonates
with Confucian thought, particularly in its emphasis on harmony and
benevolence. For both ethics:

-  **Harmony** refers to the relational and moral health of the
   community, the absence of disharmony or alienation among its members.
-  **Benevolence** refers to the mutual care, recognition, and belonging
   that sustain that harmony.

*************
 Forgiveness
*************

**Forgiveness** is the conscious decision to let go of resentment,
anger, or the desire for retribution toward someone who has caused harm.
It is a moral act because it helps restoring community wholeness:

-  Wrongdoing harms not only individuals but the community itself,
   creating disharmony: trust is eroded, and people may begin to
   dehumanize one another.

-  Punishment alone addresses personal guilt or the debt owed to the
   community, but it does not restore trust or repair relationships.

-  Forgiveness, in contrast, acknowledges the wrong while reaffirming
   the offender’s humanity, signaling that they remain a valued member
   of the community.

-  By forgiving, the community can reintegrate the wrongdoer as an equal
   member, restoring social cohesion.

-  Forgiveness also frees both parties from mistrust and alienation: the
   offended can trust the offender again, and the offender can trust
   that they will not be excluded from the community.

*********************
 Restorative justice
*********************

Ubuntu’s forgiveness is not permissive; it is conditional upon
acknowledgment, remorse, and reintegration. In Ramose’s ethics, dealing
with wrongdoing typically involves three key stages:

-  **Acknowledgment of harm:** the wrongdoer must recognize the injury
   they have caused. Truth-telling is essential, as moral repair begins
   with honest acknowledgment of the harm done.

-  **Restorative action:** the wrongdoer must actively work to repair
   the damage, whether materially, socially, or symbolically. This may
   include compensation, service, public apology, or participation in
   community healing rituals.

-  **Reintegration:** once remorse and repair are sincere, the person is
   welcomed back into the community, and reaffirmed as fully human. This
   cycle protects both the community’s harmony and the wrongdoer’s
   potential for moral transformation.

If a person repeatedly engages in wrongdoing and refuses to change, the
community may implement protective separation, but never dehumanization.
Protective separation is characterized by:

-  **Temporary exclusion:** the individual is isolated or removed from
   communal activities. The separation is always temporary, with the aim
   of eventual reintegration once transformation occurs.

-  **Continuous invitation to rejoin:** even during separation, the
   person remains part of the human circle. They are still owed
   compassion, guidance, and opportunities for restoration.

************
 Traditions
************

Ramose's ethics is inspired by African traditions that facilitate more
repair:

-  **Elders’ councils and communal gatherings:** Disputes are mediated
   by elders through dialogue and consensus. Offenders publicly
   acknowledge their wrongdoing, while victims express their pain.
   Reconciliation is often sealed by the sharing of food or drink.

-  **Rituals of reconciliation:** These ceremonies employ symbolic acts
   to reestablish relational harmony. Examples include renaming rituals
   that signify being “born again” into the community, or communal meals
   that mark reintegration and forgiveness.

-  **Community service and restitution:** Offenders may offer material
   compensation, such as cattle, goods, or labor, to the aggrieved party
   or the broader community. Elders oversee the process.

-  **Rituals of acknowledgment for repeated wrongdoing:** In cases of
   repeated offenses, the community may enact protective separation. In
   this event, rituals affirm that the offender remains part of the
   moral community and that reconciliation remains possible if they seek
   it.

***************************
 Ramose's moral guidelines
***************************

For those seeking to apply Ramose ethics, this list provides guidelines
for putting his ideas into practice.

-  **Seek harmony** Avoid gossip, conflict, and actions that create
   division. Seek reconciliation quickly when disagreements arise.
   Practice patience and forgiveness in daily interactions.

-  **Acknowledge your shortcomings:** Speak truthfully even when it’s
   uncomfortable. Apologize sincerely when you’re wrong. Take
   responsibility when you cause harm and ask for forgiveness.

-  **Seek to restore:** When wronged, seek dialogue and restoration.
   Support reconciliation circles or restorative programs in your
   community. Forgive others to restore harmony. Focus on repairing
   relationships.

-  **Respect human dignity:** Listen attentively when others speak.
   Treat every community member with equal respect. Use kind language.
   Speak up when witnessing injustice or exclusion.

-  **Care for your community:** Reflect daily on how your choices affect
   family, friends, and wider communities. Use your resources (time,
   skills, income) to support others’ growth and flourishing. Celebrate
   others’ joys and mourn with them in loss. When helped, express
   gratitude and look for ways to help in return.
