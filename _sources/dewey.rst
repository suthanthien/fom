 John Dewey
############

John Dewey (1859–1952) was an American philosopher, psychologist, and
educational reformer, widely regarded as one of the most influential
thinkers of the progressive education movement. He was a leading figure
in American pragmatism and devoted much of his work to exploring the
relationship between knowledge, experience, democracy, and ethics. Dewey
believed education was central to moral and social progress and that
schools should function as miniature democratic communities.

Although Dewey did not write a single, standalone “ethical system,” his
ethical thought is developed across several major works:

-  **Ethics (1908-1932):** Dewey’s most direct engagement with moral
   philosophy, emphasizing ethics as social inquiry and moral
   problem-solving.

-  **Democracy and Education (1916):** Explores the ethical foundations
   of education, linking moral growth with democratic participation and
   shared experience.

-  **Human Nature and Conduct (1922):** Examines morality in terms of
   habits, impulse, and intelligent reflection, with strong implications
   for moral education.

-  **Experience and Education (1938):** Clarifies the ethical
   responsibilities of educators in shaping meaningful learning
   experiences.

-  **The Public and Its Problems (1927):** Connects ethics to social
   responsibility and the role of education in sustaining democratic
   life.

 Educators
***********

Dewey holds that the educator’s role is to define and organize the
conditions for intellectual, moral and social growth. Human beings
already possess the capacity to learn, understand, and reach conclusions
independently; the educator’s task is therefore to provide the
conditions that stimulate, support, and accelerate this development.
Because individuals are not always naturally exposed to educative
experiences, the educator intentionally creates situations in which
learners encounter problems that require action, cooperation, and
participation in social life. In this sense, the educator **serves the
community** by enabling younger members to develop the capacity to live
morally and independently within it.

A good educator invites **reflective inquiry**. They encourage students
to critically examine what is known and accepted, and to reflect on the
reasons and conditions that sustain it. Students are given opportunities
to explore alternatives within a safe and guided context and to consider
the consequences of their choices. The educator recognizes that
practices and traditions are historically contingent and
context-dependent, and that students may need to revise or transform
them later in life. Preparing learners to respond intelligently to
changing circumstances is therefore a central moral responsibility of
education.

Moral behavior develops and is tested through social interaction.
Allowing students to take part in organizing shared activities is itself
a moral act, as it prepares them for the responsibilities of collective
life beyond the classroom. Good educators guide the development of
**reflective inquiry within a community of peers**. They propose
meaningful collaborative activities, such as real-life challenges or
opportunities to modify study practices, then they facilitate the
interactions to ensure they occur within a framework of open
communication, mutual respect, and constructive engagement.

Good educators demonstrate **reflective competence** in their practice.
They understand the skills and tools required for effective teaching and
remain committed to continual learning and revision of their methods.
They embody the reflective practices they advocate, adopting approaches
that promote growth and revising them when experience shows they are no
longer effective. Attentiveness to context allows the educators to adapt
teaching to the needs, backgrounds, and circumstances of learners.

One of the primary ways students learn is by observing how authority is
exercised and how individuals are treated within shared institutions.
Because educators inevitably influence students through their conduct,
they bear the responsibility to offer a **moral role model**. Educators
provide example ethical conduct by creating a safe learning environment,
treating students, parents, and colleagues with respect and dignity, and
consistently practicing moral virtues. In particular, reflective inquiry
becomes especially powerful when teachers themselves model it through
their daily work and interactions.

Finally, a good educator fosters the formation of **virtuous habits**.
Much human conduct operates through habit, and stable classroom
expectations, routines, and relationships play a crucial role in shaping
students’ social, moral, and intellectual dispositions. Effective
educators therefore explain the purposes of rules and routines,
clarifying how they support communication, cooperation, and learning. In
doing so, they help students understand how virtuous habits enable both
personal growth and effective participation in social life.

 Dewey's ethical guidelines
****************************

-  **Promote growth as the central moral aim of education:** Prioritize
   student progress. Use formative assessment to guide improvement.
   Adapt instruction to support each learner’s developmental needs.

-  **Engage in continuous ethical reflection:** Set aside time to
   reflect on classroom decisions and their outcomes. Seek feedback from
   students and colleagues about the effects of your practices. Treat
   ethical dilemmas as opportunities for professional learning.

-  **Design learning through meaningful experience:** Connect lessons to
   real-world problems, community issues, or students’ lived
   experiences. Use project-based and inquiry-based learning where
   possible. Encourage students to apply knowledge through action and
   reflection.

-  **Cultivate habits:** Establish routines that encourage listening,
   cooperation, and persistence. Reinforce positive habits through
   consistent expectations. Address behavior as a matter of habit
   formation.

-  **Model ethical behavior:** Demonstrate respect in how you speak to
   and about students. Admit mistakes openly and model how to correct
   them. Show fairness and consistency in decision-making and
   discipline.

-  **Foster democratic classroom communities:** Invite students to
   participate in setting classroom norms and expectations. Encourage
   respectful discussion and multiple viewpoints. Share responsibility
   for learning through group work and peer collaboration.

-  **Respect students as active moral agents:** Give students
   opportunities to make meaningful choices in their learning. Listen
   seriously to student reasoning, even when you disagree. Encourage
   self-assessment and reflection on learning and behavior.

-  **Encourage moral learning through action:** Use role-play,
   simulations, and collaborative problem-solving. Address ethical
   issues through lived classroom situations. Allow students to
   experience the consequences of their decisions in supportive ways.

-  **Take responsibility for social consequences of education:**
   Incorporate civic, social, and ethical issues into the curriculum.
   Encourage critical thinking about social problems and democratic
   participation. Reflect on how schooling prepares students for life
   beyond the classroom.

-  **Create inclusive and supportive environments:** Ensure materials
   and examples reflect diverse perspectives. Actively address
   exclusion, bias, or marginalization. Build relationships that affirm
   students’ dignity and belonging.

-  **Use authority ethically:** Explain the reasons behind rules and
   decisions. Gradually shift responsibility from teacher control to
   student self-regulation.

-  **View mistakes as opportunities for growth:** Approach mistakes as
   opportunities for reflection and improvement. Focus feedback on
   improvement.
