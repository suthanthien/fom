 Mozi
######

Mozi was a Chinese philosopher who lived roughly during 470–391 BCE.
Mozi came from a relatively modest background and founded the Mohist
school, which became one of the most influential intellectual movements
of early Chinese philosophy.

Unlike Confucians, who emphasized ritual, hierarchy, and tradition, Mozi
focused on practical ethics, social utility, and the reduction of
suffering. His philosophy was deeply concerned with the political
instability and constant warfare of his time.

Mozi’s ethical teachings are preserved in the text **Mozi (5th-3rd
centuries BCE)**, a compilation assembled by his followers over time.
The book contains 71 chapter which include ethical, political, military,
and logical writings.

 Engineers

The Mohists were highly skilled technical experts, specialising in
mechanical devices, construction, and logistics. Although Mozi does not
explicitly theorise about engineers as a distinct social role, his
followers clearly acted as such specialists, organised in ways that
resemble a professional category.

For Mozi, advanced technical skill exists in the **service of society**.
Actions involving technical expertise are moral insofar as they benefit
people, reduce harm, increase material welfare, or promote peace. Good
intentions alone are insufficient: those who apply technical skills must
master their craft, study its principles, and develop the ability to
anticipate the consequences of their choices. Where established
standards do not exist, they must observe outcomes, measure results, and
incorporate lessons learned into future work.

**Practising technical craft well** is therefore a moral obligation.
Mohist texts repeatedly stress the importance of accurate measurement,
the development and application of standards, and consistency in
execution. Poor workmanship or careless application risks causing harm
or undermining the effectiveness of otherwise well-intentioned
interventions.

Good practitioners of technical arts are also expected to be **frugal**.
Mozi strongly criticises waste, extravagance, and the pursuit of
prestige without social benefit. Accordingly, technical work should
optimise the use of resources, avoid unnecessary complexity, and favour
durable solutions that can be maintained or improved over time.
Simplicity is not merely an aesthetic preference but a moral one,
particularly in historical contexts where scarcity and famine were
common. Waste either causes direct harm or diminishes the benefits that
an intervention might otherwise provide.

Although Mozi does not explicitly single out technical experts as a
distinct moral class, his ethical framework implies that **those with
greater capacity to affect others bear greater responsibility**. Those
who possess specialised skills and knowledge therefore carry a heavier
moral burden, as their decisions can benefit or harm large numbers of
people.

Mozi is also aware that powerful tools can be used for harmful ends. His
condemnation of aggressive warfare establishes clear moral limits on the
application of technical skill. Mohist practitioners famously applied
their expertise to **defensive purposes**, assisting cities under
attack, while rejecting participation in wars of conquest. While Mozi
does not articulate a general theory of technological risk, his ethics
clearly reject the use of technical knowledge in service of unjust
violence, oppression, or coercion.

Finally, technical work should not serve only a privileged few, whether
rulers, elites, or their families. Central to Mohist ethics is the
principle of **impartial concern**, which demands that all people be
given equal moral consideration. Partiality breeds conflict and
undermines social order. Only when technical expertise is applied fairly
and inclusively can it fulfil its moral purpose of improving society as
a whole.

 Mozi's ethical guidelines
***************************

This is a contemporary interpretation of Mozi's ethical guidelines.

-  **Design and build only what produces real benefit for people:**
   Define explicit human-benefit criteria (e.g. safety, reliability,
   health, material welfare) at project start. Require and seek evidence
   that the problem addressed reflects genuine social need.

-  **Use technical skill for protection:** Reject work whose primary
   purpose is to enable aggression, domination, or unjustified coercion.
   Prefer applications that strengthen defence, safety, resilience, or
   the reduction of suffering. Exercise restraint where uses are
   ambiguous or easily misapplied.

-  **Hold expertise to a higher moral standard:** Take responsibility
   for understanding the foreseeable consequences of work within one’s
   domain. Do not treat obedience, custom, or compliance with authority
   as sufficient moral justification. Accept personal responsibility for
   technical choices that significantly affect others.

-  **Judge engineering success by outcomes:** Define success in terms of
   actual effects on people rather than declared goals. Monitor
   real-world performance and treat harmful or ineffective outcomes as
   failures requiring correction.

-  **Maintain rigorous standards of accuracy, measurement, and
   reliability:** Apply consistent standards and careful measurement in
   design and execution. Avoid exaggeration, omission, or distortion of
   technical results. Recognise that inaccuracy and carelessness risk
   direct harm and undermine the purpose of technical skill.

-  **Reject unnecessary complexity and extravagance:** Choose the
   simplest design capable of delivering the intended benefit safely and
   reliably. Avoid wasteful use of materials, energy, or labour that
   does not proportionally increase benefit. Favour durability,
   repairability, and long-term usefulness over novelty or display.

-  **Respect impartial concern for all affected parties:** Give equal
   moral weight to all who may be affected by technical decisions, not
   only patrons, elites, or insiders. Avoid shifting risks or burdens
   onto less powerful groups. Do not privilege particular interests at
   the expense of general welfare.

-  **Actively correct harmful systems when possible:** Challenge claims
   that harmful outcomes are unavoidable. Consider alternative designs
   or actions instead of accepting harm. Propose redesign, mitigation,
   or abandonment when systems cause harm or fail to deliver benefit.
