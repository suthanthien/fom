 Saint Thomas Aquinas
######################

Saint Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) was an Italian Dominican friar,
theologian, and philosopher, widely regarded as one of the most
influential thinkers in Western philosophy and Christian theology. He is
best known for integrating Aristotelian philosophy with Christian
doctrine. His intellectual legacy continues to shape Catholic thought
and moral philosophy to this day.

Aquinas’s ethical ideas are primarily developed in two major works:

-  **Summa Theologiae (1265–1274):** His most comprehensive and
   systematic exposition of Christian theology and ethics.

-  **Summa Contra Gentiles (1259–1265):** A work intended to explain and
   defend Christian doctrine, where moral and philosophical arguments
   are also presented.

 Natural law
*************

Aquinas argues that an act is moral when it accords with the natural
law, which he understands as the rational order established by God in
the creation of the world and of life itself. Nevertheless, for Aquinas,
knowledge of the natural law does not require an explicit acknowledgment
of God’s existence; human reason alone is sufficient to discern it.

The natural law comprises these fundamental precepts:

-  **Self-preservation:** Every being seeks to preserve its own
   existence.

-  **Procreation and the upbringing of offspring:** Living creatures
   ensure the continuation of their kind through reproduction and the
   nurturing of their young.

-  **Rational and social life:** Human beings have a natural inclination
   to seek truth and to live in community with others.

-  **Moral action:** Humans are naturally disposed to act in accordance
   with the natural law, both for their own good and for the good of
   others.

Aquinas acknowledges Aristotle’s insight that the natural law aims at
the flourishing of individuals within a community. Thus, Aristotle’s
functional argument is, for Aquinas, a rational one, and it forms an
integral part of the natural law itself.

*****************************
 Circumstances and intention
*****************************

Aquinas agrees with Aristotle that the **circumstances** surrounding an
action matter, and that practical wisdom must be exercised to determine
whether a particular act is moral. He calls this virtue prudence.
Nevertheless, Aquinas maintains that the natural law itself is absolute:
no set of circumstances can make an act contrary to natural law good.
Circumstances may only corrupt a good act. They can, however, mitigate
culpability. Aquinas acknowledges that if a person commits an evil act
under duress, they may possess some degree of justification, even if the
act itself remains immoral.

Likewise, Aquinas concurs with Kant that the **intentions** behind
actions are morally significant, and that the outcomes of actions must
be assessed in light of the natural law. A person should therefore
reflect on the likely consequences of their actions; if, within the
limits of their rational understanding, they believe the outcome to be
consistent with natural law, their intention may be deemed good. Yet,
while for Kant the only truly good thing is a good will, Aquinas insists
that an act contrary to natural law remains wrong regardless of intent.
Bad intentions can corrupt a good act, rendering it evil, but good
intentions cannot sanctify an act that violates natural law.
Nonetheless, intentions may lessen culpability: Aquinas holds that if a
person acts out of ignorance, they may possess some justification even
if their action is ultimately immoral.

Thus, although Aquinas’s conception of natural law shares common ground
with both Aristotle and Kant, it is ultimately more morally stringent.
For Aristotle, circumstances and the exercise of practical wisdom are
central to moral evaluation. For Kant, intention and rational
justification form the core of morality, and only a few moral principles
are absolute. For Aquinas, by contrast, adherence to natural law is an
essential moral criterion in conjunction with circumstances and
intentions.

**********************
 Intellectual virtues
**********************

Aquinas reinterprets Aristotle’s virtues in light of their capacity to
guide human behavior in accordance with the natural law. Among these, he
identifies four as fundamental, often referred to as the cardinal
virtues:

-  **Prudence (Practical Wisdom):** The virtue that directs all the
   others by guiding us to choose the proper means toward good ends. It
   enables us to discern what is morally right in specific
   circumstances, to act according to reason, and to avoid error.
   Prudence evaluates circumstances and consequences in light of the
   natural law, harmonizing intellect and will so that we act rightly.

-  **Temperance:** The virtue of moderation in the use of created goods.
   It restrains desires and passions, particularly those related to
   bodily pleasure, so that appetite remains under the control of
   reason. Temperance promotes harmony between reason and natural
   inclination.

-  **Justice:** The steadfast will to give each person their due.
   Justice governs our relationships with others, orienting human action
   toward fairness, equity, and social order. It safeguards the rights
   of others and upholds the obligations prescribed by natural law.

-  **Fortitude:** The virtue that strengthens the will to face
   difficulties and endure trials for the sake of the good. It enables
   perseverance in morally upright action despite fear or adversity,
   helping maintain integrity and constancy in pursuit of virtue.

*************
 Eternal Law
*************

Aquinas argues that the natural law forms part of the divine will, the
eternal law by which creation was designed and ordered. The eternal law
itself, however, lies beyond the full grasp of human reason; the
intellect alone cannot comprehend it completely. For Aquinas, the
eternal law is universal and immutable: it applies to every creature, at
all times, and in all places.

In the **Christian tradition**, the revealed dimensions of the eternal
law include the following:

-  Mysteries of Faith

   -  The Trinity: One God in three Persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit);
   -  The Incarnation: God becoming man in Jesus Christ;
   -  The Resurrection of Christ.

-  Specific Divine Commands

   -  Observing the sacraments (e.g., baptism, Eucharist);
   -  The Ten Commandments in their revealed form;
   -  Specific religious rites, prayers, or fasts mandated by God.

-  Salvation and Supernatural Ends

   -  The path to eternal life in heaven;
   -  The reality of hell and eternal punishment;
   -  The necessity of grace for salvation.

********************
 Theological virtues
********************

The theological virtues are habits of mind and character that perfect
the will and elevate the moral life. Though not strictly necessary for
moral conduct, they strengthen one’s resolve to act rightly and sustain
perseverance in the face of hardship. Unlike the intellectual virtues,
however, the theological virtues cannot be attained through reason
alone. They require participation in the rituals of the faith community
and engagement with the sacred scriptures handed down through tradition.
Through such practice, a person may be graced with divine illumination,
an insight into the eternal law.

The theological virtues are:

-  **Faith:** The virtue by which human beings believe in and accept the
   truths of the eternal law, even though complete knowledge of these
   truths is attainable only after death.

-  **Hope:** The virtue by which human beings trust in God’s providence
   and in the ultimate fulfillment of the divine plan, even in the
   absence of complete certainty in this life.

-  **Love:** The virtue by which human beings direct their will toward
   God for His own sake, without ulterior motive, and extend their love
   toward others in accordance with the eternal law.

********************
 Circle of morality
********************

Aquinas ethics provide philosophical foundation to Christian
**traditions**. These traditions are rooted in a lineage of belief
handed down from ancestors, the conviction that God has revealed His
will to a select few, and that this divine will has been recorded in the
Holy Scriptures. This belief underpins the conclusion that following
natural law is moral, because natural law is an expression of God’s
will.

However, Aquinas moves beyond these traditions to search for **universal
laws**. His reasoning bears a strong resemblance to that of Kant: a
universal law is immutable and applies to all beings. From these basic
principles, and through observation of nature and tradition, Aquinas
derives a universal moral law in accordance with nature.

For Aquinas, morality consists in conforming to nature’s rational
precepts. Human rationality enables the recognition of fundamental moral
values; yet, because rationality itself is part of the natural law, any
truths discovered through reason must also be accepted as elements of
that law.

Thus, Aquinas’ view aligns with Kant’s concept of the categorical
imperative, which serves as a criterion for judging moral and immoral
actions. The key difference lies in Aquinas’ treatment of conditional
acts. While Kant excludes conditional situations from the scope of moral
discourse, since they cannot yield categorical imperatives, Aquinas
evaluates such actions in light of the natural law, thereby filling the
gap Kant leaves open.

Furthermore, Aquinas would find no conflict with a stricter test of
morality, according to which a maxim is moral only if it can be
universalised, while its opposite cannot. Very few principles meet this
stronger criterion: truthfulness, justice, and respect for life among
them. Aquinas would likewise regard each as a precept of the natural
law.

**************************
 Aquinas moral guidelines
**************************

-  **Do good and avoid evil:** Help others, speak truthfully, act
   kindly. Build habits of virtue by consistently doing small good
   deeds. Contribute to community welfare, through civic duty, service,
   or ethical work.

-  **Seek virtue:** Think before acting; weigh consequences carefully.
   Treat everyone fairly and give others what is due to them. Persevere
   in doing good despite fear or hardship. Practice moderation in
   pleasure, consumption, and emotion. Show charity through kindness,
   forgiveness, and service.

-  **Reflect on your actions:** Use reason and conscience to discern
   right from wrong. Before acting, ask: What am I doing? Why am I doing
   it? What are the effects and context? Seek moral advice when
   intentions are unclear or mixed.

-  **Own your moral choices:** Educate your conscience through study,
   prayer, and moral reflection. Reflect on past decisions and learn
   from them. When your conscience warns you, stop and reassess your
   action or motive.

-  **Embrace the eternal law:** Seek divine help through prayer and the
   sacraments. Be humble about personal limits; seek God’s grace to
   overcome weakness. Strive to unite natural virtues with spiritual
   virtues.
