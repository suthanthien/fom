 Rāmānuja
##########

Rāmānuja (1017–1137 CE) was one of the most influential philosophers and
theologians in the Vedānta tradition of India. Rāmānuja’s thought
integrates metaphysics, devotion, and ethics into a unified vision
centered on a personal God: Nārāyaṇa/Viṣṇu.

Although none of these texts is a standalone treatise on ethics, they
collectively articulate a rich ethical framework. His key works are:

-  **The glorious commentary (c. 1100–1115):** A detailed commentary on
   the Brahma Sūtras.
-  **Gītā commentary (c. 1110–1120):** Commentary on the Bhagavad Gītā,
   including extensive ethical teachings.
-  **Summary of the meaning of the Vedas (c. 1120–1130):** Summation of
   Upaniṣadic thought from a non-dualism perspective.
-  **A manual of daily worship** and other devotional works: Practical
   guides for worship and ethical living.

 Universal law and duty
************************

At the center of Rāmānuja’s ethical outlook is dharma, the divine order
of reality and the prescribed duties through which human beings live in
harmony with it. For Rāmānuja, dharma is grounded in God’s will and
revealed through sacred scripture. The universe has structure, purpose,
and harmony because God created and sustains it, and dharma expresses
that divine purpose.

Rāmānuja understands dharma in the following way:

-  All beings exist within a real, divinely ordered universe, sustained
   by God’s governing presence.

-  Sacred scripture discloses this order and reveals the duties
   appropriate to each person’s place within it.

-  To follow dharma is to cooperate with divine intention and sustain
   the harmony of social and cosmic life.

-  Dharma is therefore both a law governing creation and a
   responsibility entrusted to creatures.

-  This divine order includes not only the physical world but also
   relationships, communities, and social responsibilities, through
   which God’s purposes are carried out.

-  To live morally is to perform these duties lovingly and faithfully,
   in a spirit of devotion.

In practice, dharma:

-  defines the proper way to live a fulfilling life and thus forms the
   foundation of morality.
-  promotes harmony in both personal conduct and social order.
-  is embraced through disciplined effort, supported by God-given
   capacities such as reason and moral discernment.
-  functions as a means through which the human being draws nearer to
   God, even though liberation ultimately depends on divine grace.

There is a structural parallel between Rāmānuja and **Aristotle**. They
both understand morality in terms of fulfilling a “function,” though the
nature of that function differs. For Aristotle, the human function is
realized through reason and social engagement, and morality consists in
cultivating virtues that enable one to flourish as a human being. For
Rāmānuja, the primary human function is faithful participation in the
divine order, and morality consists in performing one’s duties according
to dharma.

Similarly, Rāmānuja and **Kant** both emphasize morality as acting from
duty, but they differ in the source and orientation of that duty. For
Kant, moral law is determined by reason: through rational deliberation,
humans recognize the categorical imperative and act according to
principles that could be universalized. For Rāmānuja, duty is God’s
will, and the divine moral order is revealed through the holy
scriptures.

In Rāmānuja’s view, **reason** is a God-given faculty that helps human
beings understand their responsibilities and act wisely. It does not
legislate moral law on its own, but it can clarify how one ought to
carry out dharma in concrete situations and prevent impulsive or selfish
conduct. In this way, reason supports moral life without becoming its
independent foundation.

***********
 Surrender
***********

In Rāmānuja’s thought, surrender is the act of entrusting oneself
entirely to God, recognizing one’s complete dependence on Him for
protection, guidance, and liberation. It is a decisive orientation of
the soul toward God, expressed through trust and devotion. It involves:

-  trusting God as the one who upholds the cosmic order and cares for
   the soul;
-  offering one’s actions to God as loving service;
-  avoiding what conflicts with God’s will as revealed in the
   scriptures.

Surrender transforms the meaning of moral duty. Without surrender, duty
appears as a responsibility the soul undertakes to preserve its
well-being within the divine order. With surrender, duty becomes an
expression of love: service to God through the roles, relationships, and
responsibilities God has given. What was once obligation becomes joyful
service.

A conceptual parallel can be drawn with al-Ghazālī’s teachings on
sincerity: the call to act solely for God’s sake, free from self-serving
motives. Similarly, Rāmānuja understands surrender as the disposition to
perform one’s duties out of love for God alone. Though their theological
frameworks differ, both emphasize purity of intention and wholehearted
devotion in moral life.

******************
 Selfless service
******************

In Rāmānuja’s framework, selfless service is the practical expression of
surrender: serving God through the world that belongs to Him. Because
all beings and all aspects of the universe are modes of God, actions
performed for their well-being, when motivated by love for God, become
acts of devotion. Selfless service thus consists of fulfilling one’s
duties without attachment to personal gain, with the awareness that
every role and relationship is a means of serving God.

Examples of selfless service include:

-  **Caring for one’s parents:** Parents are instruments through which
   God grants life. Serving them with affection and gratitude is service
   to God.

-  **Carrying out one’s profession ethically:** Since society is
   sustained by God’s order, working honestly and contributing to
   communal welfare is a way of serving God through one’s role.

-  **Giving to those in need:** All beings are supported by God; giving
   to them in a spirit of compassion is giving to God present in them.

-  **Refraining from harming others:** Humans, animals, and the natural
   world are all upheld by God. Avoiding harm expresses reverence for
   God’s presence in all beings.

-  **Performing daily rituals, prayers, or pilgrimages:** These acts
   remind the soul of its dependence on God and express its loving
   surrender to Him.

************
 Liberation
************

While dharma shapes the moral life within the world, Rāmānuja teaches
that the ultimate goal of the soul is liberation: release from the cycle
of rebirth and eternal communion with God. Liberation is characterized
by:

-  **Loving service:** in the liberated state, the soul delights in
   unending devotion and service to God, the fulfillment of its
   essential nature.

-  **Endless bliss:** suffering and limitation fall away, replaced by
   perfect joy.

-  **Freedom from rebirth:** the cycle of saṃsāra and karmic bondage
   comes permanently to an end.

-  **Removal of ignorance:** the soul is freed from misunderstanding its
   dependence on God and attains direct, unobstructed knowledge of Him.

-  **Retention of individuality:** the soul does not dissolve into God
   but remains a distinct, and oriented toward His service.

-  **Eternal proximity to God:** the liberated soul dwells forever in
   God’s presence.

Liberation cannot be secured by human effort alone. For Rāmānuja, the
perfection of the soul lies beyond the capacity of moral action to
achieve. Dharma and surrender prepare and dispose the soul toward God,
but the final release from ignorance and bondage is granted only through
God’s **grace**. While Moral life represents the highest human
participation in God’s order, liberation is God’s free act that brings
the soul into eternal knowledge, bliss, and loving service. Moral life
is meaningful and necessary, yet always subordinate to the
transformative gift of grace that alone completes the soul’s journey to
its true end.

Rāmānuja considers hope for liberation fully compatible with a state of
surrender. True surrender involves acting in the present with humility
and detachment from personal reward, performing one’s duties as service
to God rather than as a means to an end. Hope for liberation is
entrusted to God’s will and God’s timing: the surrendered soul receives
grace when it is granted, without anxiety or demand. This hope never
becomes the primary motivation, for it must not distort the spirit of
surrender or the practice of loving service. Because liberation itself
is perfected service, surrender is the means by which the soul is
prepared, and enabled, to attain it.

 Traditions
************

Rāmānuja’s thought systematizes the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition, integrating
Vedic ritualism, devotional theism, and the Tamil bhakti poetry of the
Āḻvārs into a unified theological framework. His synthesis gives
coherent expression to the religious life of his community in these
domains:

-  **Beliefs about God:**

   -  Viṣṇu–Nārāyaṇa is the supreme God, the creator and sustainer of
      the universe.
   -  God possesses infinite compassion, justice, and knowledge, and is
      both transcendent and immanent.
   -  The Vedas, Bhagavad Gītā, and Brahma Sūtras are the foundational
      scriptures.
   -  The Tamil hymns of the Āḻvārs is recited daily in temples, taught
      to devotees, and used for cultivating devotion.

-  **Worship practices:**

   -  Temple worship is paramount, especially at sites such as
      Śrīraṅgam, where ritual, community, and theology converge.

   -  Domestic rituals include daily offerings, recitation of sacred
      names, and observance of purity rules rooted in scripture.

   -  Festivals, processions, and pilgrimages structure communal
      religious life and bring devotees into direct relation with God’s
      presence.

   -  Rites of passage mark the stages of life and integrate individuals
      into the divine order.

   -  Devotional singing and chanting deepen personal and communal
      relationship with God.

-  **Social traditions:**

   -  Duties are shaped by dharma, which orders society and individual
      stages of life in service to the cosmic order.

   -  Respect for teachers, elders, and ancestors expresses gratitude
      and recognizes one’s dependence on others.

   -  Non-harming, truthfulness, and ethical conduct are moral
      obligations grounded in dharma and divine command.

   -  The household is structured around mutual service and
      responsibility, with particular emphasis on caring for parents,
      guests, and those in need.

*******************************
 Rāmānuja's ethical guidelines
*******************************

-  **Express devotion to God:** Set aside regular time for worship,
   meditation, and recitation of God’s names. Read or listen to a small
   portion of sacred scripture each day. Remember God intentionally
   throughout daily tasks, seeing ordinary life as lived in His
   presence. Cultivate gratitude by acknowledging one’s dependence on
   God for every good.

-  **Perform selfless service:** Approach daily responsibilities,
   family, work, community, as acts of service to God. Offer time or
   skills to temple activities, communal welfare, or charitable work as
   expressions of devotion. Seek opportunities to assist others quietly
   and sincerely, recognizing all beings as belonging to God. Understand
   service to God’s devotees as a privileged form of worship.

-  **Act with universal compassion:** Treat all beings (humans, animals,
   and nature) with kindness, recognizing God as their inner ruler.
   Practice empathy and patience, especially with those experiencing
   suffering or difficulty. Make choices that protect life and minimize
   harm, in keeping with dharma. Allow compassion to shape speech,
   decisions, and relationships.

-  **Avoid injury and harmful conduct:** Refrain from harsh speech,
   dishonesty, and reactive anger; cultivate restraint and clarity of
   mind. Resolve conflicts through truthful, calm communication grounded
   in goodwill. Choose non-harmful methods whenever interacting with
   animals or the natural world. Live with simplicity and moderation,
   reducing forms of consumption that cause indirect harm.

-  **Practice humility and surrender:** Reflect daily on moments of
   pride, attachment, or self-interest, and return the mind to
   dependence on God. Acknowledge mistakes without defensiveness and
   seek reconciliation when needed. Let go of the desire to control
   outcomes; cultivate trust in God’s wisdom and protection. Affirm
   one’s attitude of surrender with simple reflections such as: “I
   belong to God; may His purpose guide my life.”

-  **Act without attachment to results:** Begin actions with pure
   intention, aiming at duty and devotion. After completing work,
   consciously release concern for praise, blame, success, or failure.
   Value sincerity and effort over external achievements. Avoid
   comparing yourself with others; measure actions by devotion and
   integrity.
