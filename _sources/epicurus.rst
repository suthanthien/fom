 Epicurus
##########

Epicurus (341–270 BCE) was an ancient Greek philosopher born on the
island of Samos and active primarily in Athens. He founded a
philosophical school known as the Garden, remarkable for its emphasis on
friendship, modest living, and philosophical therapy aimed at achieving
a happy life. Unlike many philosophers of antiquity, Epicurus saw
philosophy not as abstract speculation but as a practical art of living.

Although later caricatured as a hedonist devoted to excess, Epicurus in
fact argued for a restrained, reflective, and humane form of pleasure
centered on mental tranquility and freedom from distress.

Epicurus wrote extensively, but most of his works survive only in
fragments. His ethical thought is primarily known through:

-  **On Nature:** a 37-book work written c. 300–270 BCE, containing
   extensive ethical discussion embedded in natural philosophy
-  **Letter to Menoeceus (c. 300 BCE):** a short but central ethical
   text summarizing his views on pleasure, virtue, and happiness
-  **Principal Doctrines (early 3rd century BCE):** 40 concise ethical
   maxims
-  **Vatican Sayings (compiled later from Epicurean tradition):**
   aphorisms expanding on ethical themes

 Entertainers

.. note::

   This section applies Epicurean ethics to the role of the entertainer,
   defined as someone who brings delight. Epicurus’ philosophy aligns
   most closely with this definition. While most other ethical
   frameworks view entertainers primarily as storytellers, Epicurus
   offers a perspective that separates pure entertainment from
   storytelling.

   Since Epicurus was neither an entertainer nor a provider of a moral
   framework for entertainment, many points here represent an
   interpretative extension of Epicurean thought. Therefore, this
   chapter is a supplementary discussion and does not reinforce the
   conclusions on professional ethics laid out in the previous chapter.

Epicurus did not explicitly write about entertainers as a profession,
but his ethics can be interpreted in this context. The role of the
entertainer is to **bring delight** to the audience and free them, at
least temporarily, from pain. Human life is inevitably marked by moments
of suffering, fear, and mental distress. The entertainer offers a space
of relief, allowing people to step away from their burdens and, at
times, to find emotional relief. In this sense, freedom from suffering
is the ethical mission of the entertainer, and the means to achieve it
is moderate amusement: pleasure that calms the mind and encourages
temperance, which Epicurus explicitly identifies as essential to a happy
life.

Epicurus observes that the greatest pains in human life arise from fear:
fear of death, fear of divine punishment, fear of social ruin, and fear
of the future. The entertainer’s performance should therefore **help
ease these fears** so that they weigh less heavily on the mind. When
people learn to live with uncertainty and authority without terror,
their mental burden is reduced and they gain the capacity to pursue a
more flourishing life. In this sense, freedom from suffering may be
understood as the ethical mission of the entertainer, and the means to
achieve it is moderate amusement: pleasure that calms the mind and
encourages temperance.

Epicurus also observes that much human suffering arises from cravings
and unmet desires. An entertainer, therefore, should not replace one
craving with another, nor substitute one source of pain with a new form
of desire. A performance should soothe, satisfy, and **leave the
audience at ease**; it should not create dependency. Excessive
excitement and emotional extremes are to be avoided, because they leave
the audience agitated rather than fulfilled. Even if generating intense
excitement brings fame and success, the Epicurean entertainer remembers
that the true mission is not self-enrichment but the cultivation of
lasting pleasure and temperance.

Epicurus holds that all human beings seek pleasant feelings and avoid
pain. Therefore, the experience of entertainment should be **pleasant
for both audience and performer**. It is not ethical to bring pleasure
to others at the cost of one’s own well-being; neglecting oneself would
contradict the very mission of delight. Moreover, distress easily passes
from performer to audience: an entertainer who is anxious, exhausted, or
emotionally overwhelmed cannot reliably produce joy. For this reason,
Epicurus would advise entertainers not to work to the point of burnout,
nor to dwell on subjects they themselves find deeply distressing or
emotionally destabilizing. They should perform what genuinely brings
them peace of mind.

**Simplicity** is another essential principle. Clear language,
recognizable emotions, and shared laughter are among the most reliable
and sustainable sources of delight. Constantly pursuing sensation and
novelty, by contrast, leads to exhaustion for the entertainer and
dependency for the audience. Novelty requires relentless escalation,
which is ultimately unsustainable and disturbing. Simplicity, therefore,
is not only an artistic strategy but a way of life: the entertainer
remains at peace by valuing simple pleasures, the company of friends,
and the cultivation of temperance.

Finally, Epicurus explicitly warns against dependence on public opinion,
fame, and honor, all of which he regards as unstable and
anxiety-producing. Placing one’s happiness in public acclaim inevitably
leads to insecurity. Instead, the entertainer should rely on reasoned
judgment and make deliberate choices about style, content, and purpose.
Epicurus recommends seeking **friendship** rather than fame. Trust,
mutual support, and shared joy bring more pleasure than recognition from
strangers. Because pleasure is greatest when it is shared in stable and
communal bonds, Epicurus strongly recommends friendship as a foundation
for both life and art.

******************************
 Epicurus' ethical guidelines
******************************

-  **Bring pleasure that eases distress:** Ensure your work allows
   people to experience calm and relief from fear or anxiety. Aim for
   content that restores mental tranquility.

-  **Maintain your own well-being:** Care for your health, rest, and
   relationships. Do not sacrifice your own peace of mind in pursuit of
   entertaining others.

-  **Favor simple and natural delights:** Offer pleasures that are
   clear, intelligible, and within human understanding. Avoid excessive
   spectacle, embellishment, or novelty that leads to agitation or
   dependence.

-  **Do not exploit fear or superstition:** Avoid inciting unnecessary
   dread, whether of death, the gods, or social ruin. Where fear
   appears, present it in ways that lessen its weight and promote
   understanding.

-  **Remain independent of public opinion:** Do not allow the pursuit of
   fame, recognition, or fashion to dictate your work. Choose themes and
   styles that reflect reasoned judgment and personal integrity.

-  **Avoid stirring unnecessary desires:** Do not glorify wealth, power,
   or status as sources of happiness. Demonstrate that contentment comes
   from simple pleasures, friendship, and self-sufficiency.

-  **Show that happiness is attainable:** Portray that peace of mind and
   pleasure are within reach for ordinary people. Reinforce that joy
   arises from understanding, moderation, and relationships rather than
   extraordinary circumstances.

-  **Value friendship and cooperation:** Cultivate relationships of
   trust, mutual support, and shared pleasure in your work.
