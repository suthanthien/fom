 Immanuel Kant
###############

Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) was a German philosopher from Königsberg,
widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in Western
philosophy. His work spanned metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and
aesthetics, shaping much of modern thought. Kant’s ethical theory, known
as deontological ethics, is most famously developed in two major works:

-  **Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals** (1785) – where he
   introduces the foundation of his moral philosophy and the idea of the
   categorical imperative.

-  **Critique of Practical Reason** (1788) – where he deepens and
   systematizes his account of moral law, freedom, and duty.

************************
 Duty over consequences
************************

Kant argued that the morality of an action depends not on its outcomes,
but on whether it is done from duty, in accordance with moral law.

The logical argument can be summarized as follows:

-  A moral law is one that can be recognized as moral by every rational
   being.
-  Therefore, it must be universal and not contingent on individual
   circumstances or chance.
-  A universal law cannot have conditions, because conditional laws
   require subjective assessment, which is biased and inconsistent.
-  A moral law without conditions is a categorical imperative, something
   one ought to do regardless of circumstances or personal inclinations.
-  A moral law is followed out of duty because reason shows that it can
   be validated and willed by all rational beings.

Kant's foundational categorical imperative is **“Act only according to
that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a
universal law.”** This imperative is both a moral law and a summary of
Kantian ethics:

-  It summarizes Kantian ethics because it provides a rational test to
   judge whether a maxim is moral.
-  It is a moral law because acting according to this rational test,
   from duty, constitutes morality.

Kant suggests to tests two aspects of a categorical imperative when
universalised.

A **logical test** checks whether the maxim remains self-consistent when
universalized.

-  Example: “I will not follow reason” fails logically. Reason, by
   definition, is the shared capacity to act according to universal
   principles. A world in which no one follows reason is conceptually
   incoherent.

-  Example: “I will treat myself merely as a means” fails logically. If
   everyone treated themselves merely as a means, then no one would
   acknowledge their inherent worth as rational beings. But the very act
   of adopting and acting on a maxim presupposes rational agency, which
   must treat itself as an end. Thus, the universalized maxim is
   contradictory.

A **practical test** checks whether the maxim retains its purpose when
universalized.

-  Example: “I will deceive others for my own ends” fails practically,
   because if everyone lied, trust would vanish and deception itself
   would become impossible, defeating the original purpose.

*********
 Dignity
*********

Dignity is the inherent worth of every rational being. Dignity requires
that they be treated as an end in themselves, never merely as a means to
another’s purposes.

-  *Maxim:* **“I will treat myself and others as ends in themselves,
   respecting their rational nature.”**

-  *Purpose:* To ensure that all rational beings are valued for their
   inherent worth, rather than being used merely as means to an end.

-  *Universalized:* “Everyone will treat themselves and others as ends
   in themselves, respecting their rational nature.”

-  *Logical test:* There is no conceptual contradiction in everyone
   treating themselves and others as ends; the maxim is coherent.

-  *Practical test:* The purpose of the maxim, respecting rational
   nature, remains fully achievable when universalized, because valuing
   others’ rational nature does not prevent anyone from valuing their
   own or anyone else’s.

On the opposite end, disrespect is the failure to acknowledge the equal
rational worth and dignity of others, treating them as means rather than
ends in themselves.

-  *Maxim:* **“I will treat others merely as means to my own ends, and
   treat myself as an end.”**

-  *Purpose:* To treat oneself as an end while using others merely as
   means.

-  *Universalized:* “Everyone treats everyone else merely as a means to
   their own ends, while treating themselves as ends.”

-  *Practical test fails:* Universalization undermines the maxim’s
   purpose. By allowing everyone to treat others merely as means, I also
   allow others to treat me merely as a means. This contradicts the goal
   of treating myself as an end, making the intended purpose
   self-defeating.

*********
 Justice
*********

Justice is the consistent recognition and protection of rights and
entitlements among rational beings, ensuring that everyone is treated
according to principles that preserve equality and fairness.

-  *Maxim:* **“I will respect and uphold the rights of all rational
   beings.”**

-  *Purpose:* To ensure that the rights of all rational beings are
   respected; to create a world where everyone’s rational agency and
   entitlements are preserved.

-  *Universalized:* “Everyone will respect and uphold the rights of all
   rational beings.”

-  *Logical test:* There is no conceptual contradiction in everyone
   respecting rights; the maxim is coherent.

-  *Practical test:* The purpose of the maximm upholding rights
   universally, remains achievable when universalized, because
   respecting others’ rights does not prevent anyone from having their
   own rights respected.

On the opposite end, injustice is the violation of rights, where the
actions of one rational being undermine the lawful autonomy of another.

-  *Maxim:* **“I will ignore the rights of others while preserving my
   own rights.”**

-  *Purpose:* To secure my own advantage at the expense of the rights of
   others.

-  *Universalized:* “Everyone will ignore the rights of others while
   preserving their own rights.”

-  *Practical test fails:* Universalizing this maxim logically entails
   that others will ignore my rights just as I ignore theirs. This
   self-undermines the intended purpose of the maxim, preserving my own
   rights as an end. In a world where the same principle applies
   universally, my own rights are no longer guaranteed, making the maxim
   practically self-defeating.

*********
 Honesty
*********

Honesty: The commitment to truthfulness in communication and action,
ensuring that one’s words and deeds accurately reflect reality and
respect the rational agency of others.

-  *Maxim:* **“I will always speak the truth in my communications.”**

-  *Purpose:* To convey what I believe to be true; to ensure that my
   words accurately represent reality.

-  *Universalized:* “Everyone will always speak the truth in their
   communications.”

-  *Logical test:* There is no conceptual contradiction in everyone
   always speaking the truth; the maxim is coherent.

-  *Practical Test:* The purpose of the maxim, truthful communication,
   remains fully achievable when universalized, because universal
   truth-telling does not prevent anyone from expressing their intended
   meaning accurately.

Dishonesty is the deliberate distortion or concealment of truth.

-  *Maxim:* **“I will deceive others for my own ends.”**

-  *Purpose:* To achieve personal benefit through deception.

-  *Universalized:* “Everyone will deceive others for their own ends.”

-  *Practical test fails:* Deception requires that others sometimes
   expect truth in order for the lie to succeed. If everyone always
   deceives, the possibility of successful deception disappears because
   nobody will believe others. Thus, the intended purpose of the maxim,
   deceiving others, is self-undermined, making the maxim practically
   impossible to achieve universally.

**********
 Fairness
**********

Fairness is the equitable treatment of individuals in the distribution
of benefits, burdens, and opportunities. Fairness requires that actions
respect the interests of others without favoritism or bias.

-  *Maxim:* **“I will take no more than my share.”**

-  *Purpose:* To respect equitable distribution and ensure that everyone
   receives their due.

-  *Universalized:* “Everyone will take no more than their share.”

-  *Logical test:* there is no conceptual contradiction in everyone
   taking only their fair share; the maxim is coherent.

-  *Practical test:* The purpose of the maxim, equitable distribution,
   is fully retained when universalized, because everyone acting
   according to this principle ensures that fairness is achieved for
   all.

Unfairness is the unequal or arbitrary treatment of individuals in the
distribution of benefits, burdens, and opportunities.

-  *Maxim:* **“I will take more than my share.”**

-  *Purpose:* To obtain a greater portion than others, achieving
   relative advantage in distribution.

-  *Universalized:* “Everyone will take more than their share.”

-  *Logical test fails:* The maxim’s purpose, getting more than others,
   is inherently comparative. If everyone tries to take more than their
   share, not everyone can succeed, because “more than others”
   presupposes that some receive less. Universalization self-undermines
   the intended goal, making the maxim logically inconsistent.

***********
 Integrity
***********

Integrity is the alignment of one’s actions with rational moral
principles rather than personal inclinations or contingent
circumstances. Integrity is thus an expression of rational autonomy:
reason autonomously decides to follow moral law regardless of
inclinations or circumstances.

-  *Maxim*: **“I will always act according to my rational understanding
   of the moral law.”**

-  *Purpose:* to ensure that my actions reflect a coherent, principled
   will.

-  *Universalized:* “Everyone will always act according to their
   rational understanding of the moral law.”

-  *Logical test:* It is conceptually possible for everyone to act
   according to duty; the maxim is coherent.

-  *Practical Test:* The purpose of acting according to duty is fully
   retained when universalized. Each agent can act according to their
   rational understanding of moral law without undermining the maxim
   itself.

Heteronomy is the condition in which the will is guided by external
influences, such as desires, inclinations, or authority, rather than by
the self-legislation of pure practical reason.

-  *Maxim:* **“I will act according to my inclinations, desires, and the
   circumstances of the moment.”**

-  *Purpose:* To prioritize personal desires, inclinations, or
   convenience over rational, stable concepts.

-  *Universalized:* “Everyone will act according to their inclinations,
   desires, and circumstances of the moment.”

-  *Logical test fails:* This is a denial of a rational maxim rather
   than a valid maxim itself. It is based entirely on subjective
   circumstances and outcomes, so it cannot serve as a moral law.

***********************
 Kant moral guidelines
***********************

For those seeking to apply Kantian ethics, this list provides practical
guidelines for putting Kant’s principles into practice.

-  **Follow universal moral laws** Test your actions with the
   universalization principle: “Would it be acceptable if everyone acted
   this way?” If your action would lead to contradiction or defeat their
   own purposes if universalized, avoid it. Use this criteria as a
   decision-making filter in everyday dilemmas.

-  **Respect human dignity** When asking for help, recognize and
   appreciate the other person’s freedom and dignity. Treat each person
   as inherently valuable, not just as a tool for your goals. Avoid
   exploiting others for personal gain (e.g., manipulation, deception).
   Show respect in conversation by listening attentively and
   acknowledging others’ perspectives.

-  **Promote autonomy** Encourage others to think and decide for
   themselves rather than coercing or manipulating them. Provide clear,
   truthful information so people can make rational choices. Respect
   others’ right to refuse, even if it frustrates your goals.

-  **Be honest and keep promises** Commit only to promises you intend
   and are able to keep. Avoid “white lies” or half-truths, even when
   they seem convenient. When honesty may cause harm, focus on tactful
   communication.

-  **Uphold justice and fairness** Support fair treatment in work,
   family, and society. Resist favoritism, discrimination, or bending
   rules for personal advantage. Stand up for fairness, even when it
   doesn’t benefit you directly.

-  **Strive for moral consistency** Regularly examine your principles
   and actions for contradictions. As you expect honesty, loyalty, or
   fairness from others, make sure you live by the same standards. Keep
   a reflective journal to track whether your actions match your moral
   commitments. Cultivate integrity by holding yourself accountable even
   when nobody is watching.

*******************
 Virtues and vices
*******************

In Kantian ethics, virtues can serve as valid maxims because they are
grounded in reason and duty rather than contingent feelings or desires.
When expressed as universalizable principles, virtues articulate ways in
which rational beings can respect one another’s dignity and act
consistently with moral law:

-  **Humility:** “I will recognize my own limitations, and acknowledge
   the equal rationality of others.” When universalized, humility
   sustains mutual respect and makes rational social interaction
   possible.

-  **Kindness:** “I will act kindly toward others in recognition of
   their rational nature.” Universal kindness fosters trust and
   cooperation among rational beings.

-  **Patience:** “I will endure difficulties without diminishing the
   dignity of others.” Patience, when universalized, enables stable and
   consistent cooperation.

-  **Diligence:** “I will conscientiously fulfill my duties and
   responsibilities.” When universalized, diligence ensures that
   rational ends are pursued effectively and reliably.

-  **Charity:** “I will act benevolently toward others, supporting their
   rational and moral development.” Universal charity promotes the moral
   improvement of the community as a whole.

-  **Temperance:** “I will regulate my desires and appetites, respecting
   the needs and resources of others.” Universal temperance exemplifies
   rational self-governance and sustains fairness.

-  **Chastity:** “I will govern my desires, respecting the dignity and
   autonomy of others” When universalized, chastity protects the
   integrity of interpersonal relationships and upholds rational moral
   conduct.

Some formulations of the vices cannot serve as valid maxims under
Kantian ethics because they are grounded in feelings, desires, or
inclinations, making them conditional and subjective.

-  **Pride** “I will defend my worth when threatened.”
-  **Envy** “I will resent others’ success when their success eclipses
   mine.”
-  **Wrath** “I will act out of anger whenever provoked.”
-  **Sloth** “I will rest when I am tired.”
-  **Greed** “I will acquire more in anticipation of difficult times.”
-  **Gluttony** “I will indulge in food and drink whenever I desire.”
-  **Lust** "I will pursue sexual gratification whenever I desire.”

Other formulations, when framed as unconditional maxims, fail the test
of universalizability. They cannot be consistently willed as a universal
law without contradiction or self-defeat.

-  **Pride**: “I will elevate myself above others in thought and
   action.” Fails the practical test: if everyone elevates themselves,
   no one can achieve superiority, defeating the purpose of feeling or
   being “above others.”

-  **Envy** “I will resent others’ success and seek to undermine it.”
   Fails the practical test: if everyone undermined others’ success, I
   would also accept my own success being undermined, defeating the
   purpose of advancing relative to others.

-  **Wrath** “I will act out of anger to favor my own ends.” Wrath
   expresses disrespect for others, failing the universalization test
   because it accepts the possibility of someone else undermining my own
   ends.

-  **Sloth** “I will indulge in rest more than others do.” Expresses
   unfairness, failing the universalization test: a world in which
   everyone privileges their time of rest is logically impossible, since
   the sum of all individual excesses of rest cannot exceed the total
   available time.

-  **Greed** “I will strive to acquire more possessions.” Fails the
   practical test: if everyone pursued more possessions, what I own
   would always be under threat of being taken, undermining the purpose
   of having possessions. Universalization makes the goal of “acquiring
   more” self-defeating, because no one can securely possess more
   without others also taking.

-  **Gluttony** “I will indulge in food and drink and consume more than
   others.” Expresses unfairness, failing the universalization test
   because a world where everyone privileges themselves is logically
   impossible: the sum of individual excesses cannot exceed the total
   available.

-  **Lust** “I will pursue sexual gratification using people as objects
   rather than ends.” Lust expresses disrespect for others, failing the
   universalization test because if everyone acted this way, I would
   accept the possibility that others could use or exploit me,
   undermining my own ends.

***********************************
 Silver, golden and platinum rules
***********************************

These rules are not universal in the Kantian sense, because they depend
on personal or subjective desires. If someone’s desires are immoral or
biased, the rule could justify actions that violate true moral law.

-  **Silver rule**: “Do not do to others what you would not want done to
   yourself.”
-  **Golden rule:** “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.”
-  **Platinum rule:** “Treat others as they wish to be treated.”

However, these rules can be grounded in shared rational preferences,
such as dignity, which allows them to align with Kant’s definition of
moral laws:

-  **Silver rule (with dignity):** “I will not treat others without
   dignity, as I would not want to be treated without dignity myself.”

-  **Golden rule (with dignity):** “I will treat others with dignity, as
   I would want to be treated with dignity myself.”

-  **Platinum rule (with dignity):** “I will treat others in a way that
   respects their dignity, as that is how all rational beings would wish
   to be treated.”

*******************************
 From traditions to principles
*******************************

When Immanuel Kant first developed his moral philosophy in the late
eighteenth century, his project was largely academic. His goal was not
to reform politics or social practice directly, but to explore whether
morality could be grounded in something stable and universal. Instead of
appealing to God, social rank, or utility, Kant sought to show that
reason itself could serve as the foundation of moral thought. Every
rational being possesses dignity, and moral laws must apply universally
without exception.

At first, this seemed like an abstract professor’s exercise. But the
cultural landscape of Europe was already preparing the ground for Kant’s
ideas to resonate more widely.

Religious divisions had fractured the authority of the church. Where
once a single creed demanded obedience, there were now multiple
competing confessions. People gradually adopted **habits of tolerance**,
not out of indifference, but out of necessity. Freedom of conscience
became a practical way of coexisting, and dignity began to be recognized
independently of belonging to the “true” faith.

Meanwhile, the nobility and aristocracy were forced to recognize the
rising influence of bureaucrats, merchants, and professionals. Status
was no longer tied exclusively to birth. Skill, education, and service
in administration or commerce demanded respect, and with that came **a
new appreciation for dignity rooted in personal ability** rather than
inherited privilege.

At the same time, social life was changing. The decline of inquisitorial
controls and the gradual improvement of living standards allowed people
to form wider circles of debate. Coffeehouses, salons, and newspapers
became spaces for open discussion, where **ideas were tested by reason**
rather than imposed authority. In these exchanges, appeals to universal
principles gained traction.

The question of slavery added a further moral test. **Europeans had long
since abandoned slavery** within their own borders, so its
reintroduction through colonial expansion shocked many. It revealed the
inconsistency of moral theories that made exceptions, granting dignity
to some while denying it to others. People recognized that partial
frameworks, whether religious, hierarchical, or utilitarian, could
always be bent to justify exploitation.

In this context, Kant’s theory gained its force. Unlike other moral
systems, it offered a framework that made no exceptions. By grounding
dignity in rational nature itself, **it guaranteed equal worth to every
person**, regardless of faith, rank, skill, or circumstance. Over time,
this abstract philosophy became the most trustworthy foundation for
modern moral thought, precisely because it treated all human beings with
the same unconditional respect.

In sum, Kant’s moral philosophy arose as **a systematic reflection on
the new social and cultural habits of the eighteenth century:** the
practice of religious tolerance, the recognition of dignity through
skill and labor, the flourishing of rational public debate, and the
enduring rejection of slavery. By grounding morality in reason itself,
Kant provided a universal and exceptionless foundation that could
explain, justify, and unify **these evolving traditions**, offering a
coherent account of human dignity that resonated with the moral
consciousness of his time, and continues to do so today.

*************************
 To situated experiences
*************************

Kant acknowledges that the test of universalization is not infallible
when applied across different contexts. A maxim that appears valid
within one community may fail to be universalizable in another.

This tension became evident during the upheavals of the sixteenth
century. In medieval Europe, the maxim “I will follow the teachings of
the Church” seemed unproblematic, since the Church represented a unified
authority. However, with the Reformation, the Church fractured into
competing denominations, and the maxim lost its universality: to follow
“the Church” no longer had a clear, universally shared meaning.

For Kant, this underscores the importance of expanding the circle of
moral consideration beyond narrow traditions or institutions. When we
ground our maxims in respect for the inherent dignity of all persons, we
arrive at principles that are more stable and broadly applicable.
**Integrity, fairness, justice, and honesty** are not contingent on
historical institutions but arise from pure reason, which is shared by
all human beings.

**Other maxims** may initially appear valid in a limited context,
passing the logical and practical tests, yet prove insufficient when the
circle of consideration is widened to include different cultures or
circumstances. Through **situated experiences**, actively engaging with
the social realities, norms, and perspectives of others, one can observe
where a maxim succeeds and where it may fall short. By reflecting on
these experiences, one can reconsider the maxim in light of broader
human contexts, cultivating new habits of thought and action that align
more closely with reason and respect for the dignity of others. Over
time, this iterative process allows for the gradual refinement of
maxims, shaping principles that are not only rationally sound but also
more universally applicable and resilient across diverse human contexts.
