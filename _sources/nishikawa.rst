 Nishikawa Jōken
#################

Nishikawa Jōken (1648–1724) was a Confucian thinker, educator, and
practical moralist active during Japan’s early Edo period. Born in
Nagasaki and later active in Osaka, he lived at a time when commerce was
expanding rapidly and merchants were becoming economically powerful yet
remained socially marginalized within the Tokugawa status system.

Nishikawa focused on applied ethics: how moral principles should govern
everyday economic and social life. He is best known for adapting
Confucian moral thought to the realities of commoners, especially
merchants, farmers, and artisans.

Nishikawa’s ethical thought appears mainly in practical instructional
texts written in accessible language:

-  **Merchant’s Bag (1719):** His most influential work, offering moral
   guidance specifically for merchants, covering honesty, profit,
   frugality, and social responsibility.

-  **Farmer’s Bag (1719):** A companion volume applying similar ethical
   principles to agricultural life.

-  **Complete Book of Agriculture (1697):** Though focused on farming,
   it includes moral reflections on labor, diligence, and harmony with
   nature.

Nishikawa argues that the essential function of the merchant is the
**circulation of goods** across society. Merchants ensure that useful
goods are accessible to the community as a whole. Without merchants,
goods would remain unevenly distributed: surplus would decay in one
place while scarcity persisted in another. Merchants transport goods
across space and time by purchasing during periods of abundance, storing
resources, and releasing them when demand arises. In this way, they
stabilize society by preventing waste and alleviating shortage.
Nishikawa further observes that merchants who accumulate goods wield
significant **power** over others during times of crisis, since access
to essential resources becomes dependent on their decisions. Because
this power directly affects the well-being of the population, it carries
ethical responsibility. Merchants must therefore avoid exploiting
shortages through hoarding and instead release goods during crises,
thereby preserving social stability and maintaining the conditions that
make commerce itself possible

Nishikawa permits merchants to earn a profit from their profession, but
he is clear that profit is not an end in itself. Rather, profit enables
the continuation of merchant activity, much as a farmer earns a living
through labor. The pursuit of profit is therefore legitimate only
insofar as it supports the proper functioning of commerce. From this
perspective, **profit reflects the successful fulfillment** of the
merchant’s role: goods reach the right place at the right time,
customers return willingly, and exchange proceeds smoothly. Profit thus
emerges as recognition that the merchant is fulfilling their social role
effectively.

**Frugality** is a central virtue in Nishikawa’s account of merchant
ethics. Merchants should not pursue profit in order to display wealth,
seek fame, or imitate the lifestyle of the nobility. Such behavior does
not confer genuine legitimacy and instead threatens social harmony by
blurring established social roles. Nishikawa holds that merchants ought
to earn respect through reliable service, fair transactions, and the
provision of economic stability. Moral worth derives from conduct rather
than outward display, and a merchant who conducts business with
sincerity and integrity deserves greater esteem than one who merely
seeks status. Frugality also reinforces moral stability: merchants
accustomed to luxury become vulnerable to ethical compromise when
profits decline. By contrast, restraint preserves independence of
judgment and enables merchants to act rightly even in difficult times.

**Honesty and sincerity** are foundational virtues in Nishikawa’s
ethical framework. A merchant must accurately represent the value of
goods and remain committed to serving customers through the proper
distribution of resources. Commercial activity depends on trust, and
Nishikawa emphasizes that deception erodes the basis of exchange itself.
When trust is lost, customers withdraw, and the merchant loses both
livelihood and social function. Over time, consistent honesty generates
reputation, which sustains commercial relationships across repeated
interactions. While reputation is not monetary profit, Nishikawa treats
it as an enduring asset of moral conduct, without which financial gain
cannot be sustained.

Nishikawa also emphasizes the cultivation of inner virtues, particularly
**self-control and judgment**. Merchants must learn to govern desire, as
those ruled by unchecked desire become unstable, fearful, and prone to
misconduct. Self-control restores clarity and allows reason to guide
action. Alongside this, Nishikawa stresses the importance of learning
and moral cultivation. Markets continually present situations that
cannot be resolved by fixed rules alone, and merchants must exercise
discernment in changing circumstances. Refined judgment enables
merchants to act correctly even when faced with ambiguity, temptation,
or unfamiliar conditions.

Finally, Nishikawa places strong value on **diligence and practical
competence**. Merchants must develop the technical skills and knowledge
necessary to perform their craft effectively, including transportation,
storage, and the maintenance of social relationships. Moral intention
alone is insufficient; effective execution is essential to fulfilling
the merchant’s social role. By circulating goods efficiently and
reducing waste, skilled merchants contribute to social stability. In
this sense, competence possesses moral significance, as it strengthens
the merchant’s ability to serve society through commerce.

 Nishikawa's ethical guidelines
********************************

-  **Conduct trade with honesty and sincerity:** Use accurate
   descriptions of goods. Disclose defects or limitations openly before
   a sale. Honor verbal agreements even when they are not legally
   enforceable. Use standardized, accurate weights and measures. Keep
   accounting records clear and truthful. Train employees to follow the
   same standards of transparency.

-  **Treat partners, and competitors with fairness:** Negotiate terms
   transparently and respectfully. Honor partnerships even when better
   offers appear. Compete through quality and service.

-  **Seek profit in moderation:** Set prices that reflect fair value.
   Avoid speculative practices that create artificial scarcity. Aim to
   sustainable profit. View profit as a means of stability, not as an
   end in itself.

-  **Practice frugality and restraint:** Reinvest earnings into the
   business rather than conspicuous consumption. Maintain simple
   personal habits regardless of income level. Control unnecessary
   expenses that inflate prices or invite greed. Separate business funds
   from personal indulgence.

-  **Take healthy pride in your social role:** Focus on excellence
   within commerce instead of status display. Avoid wasteful luxury
   meant to signal rank. Measure worth by integrity and service.

-  **Maintain diligence and hard work:** Attend closely to inventory,
   quality, and customer needs. Avoid complacency after achieving
   success. Supervise business operations regularly. Treat diligence as
   a moral habit.

-  **Place long-term reputation above short-term gain:** Decline
   transactions that may harm trust. Resolve disputes fairly. Accept
   short-term losses to preserve customer confidence. Build
   relationships based on repeat dealings.

-  **Recognize commerce as a socially necessary role:** Ensure goods are
   available where and when they are needed. Maintain stable supply
   chains. Understand business success as contributing to social
   circulation. Act with awareness of how decisions affect the wider
   community.

-  **Align self-interest with the common good:** Balance profit-making
   with customer welfare. Avoid practices that harm producers, workers,
   or consumers. Price essentials responsibly, especially during
   hardship. See ethical success as mutually beneficial. Coordinate with
   local authorities or guilds to ensure fairness. Avoid profiting from
   disasters or public distress.

-  **Cultivate wisdom through learning and reflection:** Study moral
   teachings and past business failures. Reflect regularly on motives
   behind decisions. Seek advice from respected peers known for
   integrity. Teach ethical principles to apprentices and successors.
