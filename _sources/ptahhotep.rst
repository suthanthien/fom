 Ptahhotep
###########

Ptahhotep was a high-ranking Egyptian official who served as vizier
during the Fifth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, under the reign of Pharaoh
Djedkare Isesi, around c. 2375–2350 BCE. As vizier, Ptahhotep held one
of the most powerful administrative roles in ancient Egypt, overseeing
justice, taxation, public works, and the bureaucracy of the state.

In his advanced age, Ptahhotep is traditionally credited with composing
a wisdom text intended to instruct his successor, and future leaders, on
ethical conduct in public life. This work became one of the foundational
texts of Egyptian moral and political philosophy.

Ptahhotep’s ethical teachings are preserved in a text commonly known as
**The Instruction of Ptahhotep (2375-2350 BCE)**. The most complete
version comes from the Prisse Papyrus (1850 BCE). The text is a guide to
ethical judgment, social harmony, and the responsible exercise of
authority.

 Ethical rule
**************

According to Ptahhotep, the actions of a ruler must accord with the
divine and natural order that sustains the world. It is the ruler’s
moral duty to uphold this order through just judgment and proper
administration. When injustice occurs, the natural order is disturbed,
and disorder follows, bringing loss of favor and unrest among people. A
good ruler therefore seeks to preserve peace and balance, placing the
**stability of the community** above personal ambition.

Divine and natural order is maintained not merely through laws, but
through **the character of the ruler**. A leader’s conduct sets a
visible example for others, and when authority is exercised with virtue,
it encourages virtue in those under it and reinforces social order. The
following is a list of virtues Ptahhotep considered essential for
ethical governance:

-  **Justice:** Justice, in Ptahhotep’s teaching, requires impartial
   judgment. A ruler must not favor one person over another, for
   favoritism reveals that judgment has been corrupted. When people see
   that decisions are made according to personal preference rather than
   fairness, respect for order diminishes and harmony weakens. For this
   reason, Ptahhotep repeatedly warns against bribery and dishonest
   gain. What is taken unjustly may benefit one person for a moment, but
   it weakens order and brings harm in the long run.

-  **Humility:** Wisdom, Ptahhotep insists, is not confined to rank or
   office. A ruler who assumes superiority closes himself to
   understanding, while humility allows him to hear truth wherever it is
   spoken. For this reason, the ruler must listen attentively to
   advisors and petitioners alike.

-  **Patience:** Ptahhotep warns that anger and excess cloud judgment
   and lead to injustice. The ruler who governs himself can govern
   others with consistency. Through restraint and patience, decisions
   are guided by reason rather than impulse, allowing the divine order
   to be upheld in practice.

-  **Kindness:** The strength of a ruler is shown in how he treats those
   without power. Ptahhotep cautions against oppression and urges
   protection of the weak, for unchecked injustice multiplies and
   disrupts harmony. By safeguarding the vulnerable, the ruler preserves
   balance and fulfills his responsibility to the divine order.

Ptahhotep counsels rulers to consider both the wisdom they inherit and
the legacy they leave through their actions:

-  **Respect for inherited wisdom:** A moral ruler honors teachings and
   practices passed down from earlier generations, which embody
   experience aligned with the divine order. Sudden or reckless
   departure from established ways risks disturbance. While discernment
   is always required, continuity is preferable to novelty, and a wise
   ruler builds upon what has proven enduring.

-  **Preservation of wisdom for the future:** A ruler’s office is
   temporary. Those who act against the divine order do not endure:
   their authority fades and their name is not remembered. By contrast,
   wisdom and just conduct are preserved across generations, and acting
   rightly ensures that one’s deeds are honored beyond one’s lifetime.

Finally, Ptahhotep places great importance on speech. Words have the
power to calm or to inflame. Thoughtless speech spreads confusion, while
measured and truthful speech resolves conflict and restores harmony. For
a ruler, **mastery of speech** is therefore an essential part of just
governance.

********************************
 Ptahhotep's ethical guidelines
********************************

-  **Seek harmony**: Consider the well-being of the community rather
   than personal gain. Measure success by trust, stability, and lasting
   reputation.

-  **Practice humility and listen to counsel:** Recognize that wisdom
   can come from any person, regardless of rank. Hear advice carefully,
   evaluate ideas on their merit, and acknowledge mistakes when they
   occur.

-  **Cultivate self-control and patience:** Do not act in anger or
   haste. Delay judgment when emotions are strong, and act with
   moderation and reflection. Seek counsel when necessary before making
   important decisions.

-  **Judge impartially:** Treat all people fairly, without favoritism or
   bias. Hear every side fully before deciding, and act consistently
   according to justice.

-  **Lead by example:** Align personal conduct with public duties.
   Demonstrate integrity and ethical behavior even when it is
   inconvenient.

-  **Use words carefully:** Speak truthfully, clearly, and with
   restraint. Avoid speech that causes confusion, conflict, or dishonor.
   Remain silent if it helps preserving order.

-  **Protect the Vulnerable:** Safeguard those without power, the weak,
   and the marginalized. Prevent exploitation and oppression.

-  **Respect tradition and preserve Wisdom:** Honor the teachings and
   experience of previous generations. Do not abandon what is enduring
   without careful judgment. Implement change gradually.
