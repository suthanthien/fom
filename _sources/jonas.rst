 Hans Jonas
############

Hans Jonas (1903–1993) was a German philosopher best known for
developing an ethical framework suited to the technological age. Born in
Mönchengladbach, Germany, he studied philosophy and theology under
thinkers such as Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann. Fleeing Nazi
Germany in the 1930s, Jonas later emigrated to Palestine and then to the
United States, where he taught philosophy for many years. His
experiences of totalitarianism, war, and modern technology shaped his
ethical thought.

Although Jonas wrote on many topics, especially Gnosticism and
philosophy of biology, his ethical contributions emerged primarily in
the second half of his career:

-  **The Phenomenon of Life (1966):** A collection of essays in
   philosophical biology that laid the groundwork for his ethics by
   arguing for the intrinsic value of life and a continuity between mind
   and nature.

-  **The Imperative of Responsibility (1979):** Jonas’s most influential
   ethical work. Here he formulates a new ethical principle designed for
   a technological civilization capable of affecting the future of
   humanity and the biosphere.

-  **Later Essays on Ethics and Technology (1985 - 1992):** Jonas
   continued refining his views in essays on biotechnology, medical
   ethics, and ecological responsibility.

For Hans Jonas, modern engineers operate with technologies whose
potential impact is unprecedented in scale. Their actions can affect not
only societies but the very conditions for the continued existence of
humanity. It is therefore more imperative than ever that engineers
carefully consider the effects of their work on people, society, and the
natural world as a whole.

Although Jonas does not explicitly refer to Mozi, his ethical framework
exhibits similarities to Mohist ethics, particularly the claim that
those who wield **great power bear correspondingly greater
responsibility**. Jonas also shares with Mozi the conviction that
practitioners must anticipate the future consequences of their actions
and exercise rigorous diligence before acting.

While Mozi did not confront challenges of this magnitude, due to the
more limited reach of technologies in his time, Jonas emphasises that it
is no longer sufficient to evaluate technological outcomes solely for
those who are currently living or geographically nearby. Modern
technologies can affect people across vast distances and far into the
future. Jonas thus extends moral responsibility beyond present
populations to encompass **future generations** and the long-term
conditions of human life, an extension he considers necessary given the
scope and power of contemporary technology.

Jonas further argues that reliance on trial-and-error approaches and the
assumption of reversibility, which often underlie scientific and
technological progress, are no longer adequate in the technological age.
Whereas in Mozi’s time harmful outcomes were typically limited in scale
and could often be corrected, modern technology can exceed the
resilience of natural and social systems. Experimenting first and
observing outcomes afterward may introduce **irreversible changes**,
potentially leading to catastrophic and uncontrollable harm. Jonas does
not reject scientific knowledge as such, but insists that empirical
observation alone is insufficient when the stakes involve the future of
humanity.

For this reason, Jonas introduces what he calls a **“heuristics of
fear.”** This is an appeal to a rational and anticipatory ethical
attitude: a disciplined willingness to take seriously the worst
plausible consequences of technological action. Engineers, on this view,
should allow such anticipatory concern to guide restraint, avoiding
actions whose potential outcomes include irreversible or devastating
harm.

 Jonas' ethical guidelines
###########################

-  **Act responsibly toward long-term consequences:** Evaluate decisions
   not only by short-term gains but by their effects over decades or
   generations. Ask explicitly: “What happens if everyone does this for
   a long time?” Support policies and practices that include long-term
   impact assessments.

-  **Take responsibility for future generations:** Defend the interests
   of children and unborn generations in political and institutional
   decision-making. Support sustainable education, healthcare, and
   environmental policies. Avoid actions that create irreversible
   burdens.

-  **Preserve the conditions for authentic human life:** Protect basic
   human needs: clean air, water, food, and social stability. Promote
   human dignity in technological and economic systems.

-  **Exercise restraint with powerful technologies:** Delay or limit the
   deployment of technologies with unpredictable consequences. Require
   independent ethical review before large-scale technological
   implementation. Favor reversible and controllable technologies over
   irreversible ones.

-  **Prioritize avoiding catastrophe:** Apply the precautionary
   principle in high-risk situations. Reject projects where potential
   damage is massive, even if probability seems low. Design policies
   that minimize worst-case outcomes. Treat fear as a signal for
   caution.

-  **Respect life as intrinsically valuable:** Support ethical standards
   in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. Foster attitudes of care
   toward animals, ecosystems, and vulnerable humans.

-  **Practice responsibility toward the vulnerable:** Protect those who
   cannot protect themselves: children, the poor, future generations,
   non-human life. Design institutions that give voice to the powerless.
   Measure ethical success by how the weakest are treated.

-  **Subordinate technological progress to ethical reflection:**
   Integrate ethics committees into scientific, medical, and industrial
   decision-making. Require ethical education for engineers, scientists,
   and policymakers. Pause innovation when ethical understanding lags
   behind technical capability.
