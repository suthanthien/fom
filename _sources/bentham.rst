 Jeremy Bentham
################

Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) was an English philosopher, jurist, and
social reformer, widely regarded as the founder of classical
utilitarianism. Trained in law, Bentham became deeply dissatisfied with
what he saw as the arbitrariness, inefficiency, and moral obscurity of
existing legal and political institutions. His life’s work was devoted
to reforming law, governance, and public administration through a
rational, systematic ethical principle.

Bentham believed that political authority should be justified not by
tradition, divine right, or abstract natural rights, but by its
measurable contribution to human well-being.

Bentham’s ethical theory is developed across several major works:

-  **An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation
   (1789):** His foundational ethical text, where he formulates the
   principle of utility and the famous hedonic calculus.

-  **A Fragment on Government (1776):** An early critique of traditional
   constitutional theory, applying utilitarian reasoning to political
   authority.

-  **The Rationale of Punishment (written c. 1780s, published 1830):**
   Applies utilitarian ethics to criminal justice and penal policy.

-  **Constitutional Code (1820s, published posthumously):** A detailed
   utilitarian blueprint for public administration, bureaucratic
   accountability, and democratic governance.

 Governance
************

Unlike many virtue-based ethical traditions, Bentham grounds ethics in a
simple empirical observation: human beings are motivated by the pursuit
of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. For Bentham, these experiences
provide the ultimate standard for moral evaluation. Intellectual
achievements, moral sentiments, and cultural ideals are not rejected,
but they are not ends in themselves; their moral importance lies in
their tendency to **promote happiness or prevent suffering**. From this
perspective, the task of the statesman or lawmaker is to guide society
toward higher levels of welfare. Through legislation, policy design, and
public administration, political authority must be exercised so as to
maximize overall happiness while minimizing the suffering imposed by
collective decisions.

Bentham understands happiness and suffering as aspects of welfare that
can be compared through their **impact on tangible conditions** such as
health, safety, security, material living standards, access to education
and work, and freedom from fear and uncertainty. For this reason,
Bentham treats political decision-making as a practical discipline. The
statesman should reason in a manner analogous to an engineer: gathering
evidence about social conditions, anticipating likely outcomes, choosing
among available trade-offs, and revising policies in light of
experience.

Bentham rejects the doctrine of “natural rights” as a foundation for
political judgment. He argues that rights are not gifts of nature but
creations of law and institutions, justified by their usefulness in
securing social welfare. Nevertheless, he firmly defends the **principle
of equal consideration** as a requirement of rational policymaking. The
pleasure or pain experienced by one person does not differ in kind from
that experienced by another, regardless of status or position.
Accordingly, when evaluating public decisions, each individual’s welfare
must be weighed impartially and without privilege.

Because statesmen are **responsible for the actual outcomes** of their
decisions, Bentham holds that they have a moral obligation to cultivate
the skills required to anticipate consequences and choose effectively
among competing options. This responsibility includes a duty of
**transparency**: policymakers must make their reasoning public and
invite scrutiny and criticism. Open debate and institutionalized
accountability do not guarantee perfect decisions, but they improve the
likelihood that errors will be identified and corrected over time.

Bentham also places special emphasis on the **prevention of serious
suffering**. While his utilitarian framework allows for trade-offs and
recognizes that some harms may be unavoidable, he argues that conditions
such as fear, insecurity, and severe deprivation typically impose costs
that far outweigh minor or speculative gains in happiness. Creating or
tolerating such conditions, when less harmful alternatives are
available, represents a grave moral failure of governance.

Finally, Bentham maintains that political authority is justified only by
its **effectiveness in promoting public welfare**. The legitimacy of a
statesman or lawmaker depends on their capacity to improve social
conditions in practice, not on status, tradition, or intention. Those
who hold office must therefore continually refine their competence,
remain attentive to changing realities, and demonstrate the benefits of
their actions to the public. When authority persistently fails to serve
its purpose, Bentham’s logic implies that it should give way, through
institutional mechanisms, to more capable forms of leadership.

 Virtues
*********

Although Bentham does not regard virtues as ends in themselves, he
recognizes their practical importance:

-  **Honesty:** Bentham considers honesty essential because it builds
   trust between the government and the governed. A statesman who acts
   truthfully reduces social friction, ensures smoother implementation
   of laws, and prevents misunderstandings that could cause unnecessary
   suffering.

-  **Practical wisdom:** A statesman needs to anticipate the likely
   consequences of policies and decisions. By carefully considering
   potential outcomes, avoiding harmful side effects, and weighing
   trade-offs between different pleasures and pains, a prudent statesman
   is more likely to design laws and policies that genuinely maximize
   happiness.

-  **Courage and integrity:** Courage and integrity equip leaders to
   pursue beneficial policies even when they are politically risky or
   unpopular. Without these traits, self-interest, fear, or external
   pressures might prevent a statesman from enacting reforms that
   increase public welfare.

-  **Temperance:** Moderation helps prevent extreme or reckless actions
   that could generate unnecessary suffering. A temperate statesman
   balances competing interests, avoids overreach, and ensures that
   policies do not create avoidable pain in the process of pursuing
   happiness.

-  **Diligence:** Bentham emphasizes the importance of sustained effort
   in administration. A diligent statesman actively monitors policies,
   enforces laws efficiently, and continuously evaluates social
   outcomes.

-  **Fairness:** Impartiality ensures that all citizens’ pleasures and
   pains are considered equally. A statesman who treats people fairly
   avoids favoritism, corruption, and arbitrary privilege.

*****************************
 Betham's ethical guidelines
*****************************

-  **Decide policies using measured outcomes:** Require cost–benefit or
   impact analyses before passing laws. Set measurable targets (e.g.
   reduced harm, improved access, lower costs). Schedule automatic
   reviews for major policies.

-  **Prioritize policies that reduce predictable harms:** Focus
   resources on health, safety, poverty prevention, and risk reduction.
   Act early on problems where prevention is cheaper than repair. Rank
   issues by severity and number of people affected.

-  **Include all affected groups in policy evaluation:** Identify who
   gains and who loses from each decision. Collect disaggregated data
   (income, region, age, vulnerability). Avoid policies that benefit
   small groups at large public cost.

-  **Replace intuition and tradition with evidence:** Pilot new policies
   before full implementation. Consult empirical research and
   independent experts. End programs that fail despite political or
   historical support.

-  **Design laws and rights to solve concrete problems:** Define rights
   and regulations in terms of the harms they prevent. Adjust legal
   protections when laws systematically undermine welfare.

-  **Make laws simple and predictable:** Use plain language and avoid
   vague standards. Reduce discretionary power where it leads to
   inconsistent outcomes. Communicate legal changes clearly and well in
   advance.

-  **Use punishment only when it prevents greater harm:** Compare
   punitive and non-punitive responses to wrongdoing. Eliminate
   penalties that do not reduce future offenses. Invest in
   rehabilitation where it yields better outcomes.

-  **Match administrative effort to social benefit:** Simplify
   procedures that impose high burdens for low benefit. Digitize or
   streamline services where it reduces citizen time and stress. Treat
   delays, complexity, and inefficiency as real social costs.

-  **Build systems that discourage corruption and abuse:** Separate
   decision-making, oversight, and enforcement functions. Make spending
   and procurement publicly traceable. Rotate sensitive positions and
   limit discretionary authority.

-  **Continuously revise policies based on results:** Publish outcome
   data and evaluation reports. Admit failure early and revise policy
   accordingly. Reward correction and learning.

-  **Treat authority as conditional on performance:** Tie leadership
   tenure and administrative authority to outcomes. Accept institutional
   checks, audits, and public scrutiny. Step aside or restructure roles
   when policies consistently fail.
