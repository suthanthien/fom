 Duty and Autonomy
*******************

Across the thinkers examined in this chapter, a shared ethical
foundation emerges. All agree that the role of the ruler, whether as
policymaker, public administrator, or community leader, is to promote
social harmony. The term harmony is used here in a broader sense than
the meaning Confucius originally gave it. Here, harmony refers to the
seamless integration of members of a society in such a way that they
form a well-functioning community capable of enduring beyond the
lifespan of any individual. While all thinkers value harmony, they
differ in how it is realized: in the roles individuals play, in the
“tune” society follows, and in how rulers organize collective life.

We can imagine a spectrum of harmonies, ranging from those that place
greater emphasis on duty to those that prioritize autonomy. The examined
political theories fall somewhere between these poles.

-  **Duty-based harmonies** are grounded in the concept of obligation.
   When a person comes into existence, they do so as a member of a
   preexisting society. That society holds certain expectations about
   how new members ought to behave throughout their lives. At a minimum,
   individuals are expected to abide by established rules. More deeply,
   they are expected to respect these rules, since it is precisely these
   inherited duties that sustain the society into which they were born
   and make their own lives possible.

-  **Autonomy-based harmonies**, by contrast, are based on the idea that
   society is largely self-organizing. Individuals pursue their personal
   aspirations, and these pursuits tend, on the whole, to fit together
   in a harmonious way. People acquire few obligations by birth beyond
   compliance with the law. Laws typically prohibit certain actions, but
   they do not prescribe how one must live. Individuals are expected to
   form, revise and choose their own commitments in light of what they
   value, and they are then responsible for honoring those self-chosen
   obligations.

 Virtues
*********

All of the thinkers considered agree that **moral conduct** is a
fundamental requirement for rulers and community leaders. Both
autonomy-based and duty-based societies view moral character as
instrumental to effective governance. Virtues make leaders more capable
in practice and, equally importantly, signal trustworthiness: society
must be able to rely on them to make sound and responsible decisions.
Duty-based societies place an even stronger emphasis on virtue. In these
contexts, a ruler is expected not only to govern effectively but also to
embody tradition, adhering to established norms and serving as a moral
exemplar for others.

Among the virtues most frequently emphasized is **humility**: an
understanding that a leader’s actions and perspective are not superior
to those of everyone else in society. Humility takes different forms
across the two types of social harmony. In an autonomy-based society,
humility consists in recognizing that the administrators serve the
public, that their own conception of value is not inherently superior,
and that governance requires the integration of diverse perspectives. In
a duty-based society, humility reflects recognition that tradition,
divine order, or harmony itself represents a higher value than the
ruler’s personal authority or ego.

**Justice** is another central virtue. The role of the ruler or
administrator is closely tied to the maintenance of justice, as they
function as its guarantors. In duty-based societies, justice consists in
upholding the obligations that individuals have learned to expect across
generations. In autonomy-based societies, justice is more closely
associated with equality of opportunity and agency.

**Practical Wisdom** is also an important virtue. A ruler must be able
to understand the situation, anticipate the likely consequences of
actions, and make decisions that best promote enduring social harmony.
Especially in autonomy-based societies, no single set of values can be
applied mechanically in every circumstance; each situation must be
carefully assessed to determine whether actions truly foster harmony.
Even in duty-based societies, it is necessary to evaluate whether
particular circumstances warrant exceptions to what tradition
prescribes.

Finally, **skill in communication and mediation** is identified as an
essential leadership trait. A leader must communicate clearly, act
honestly, defuse conflicts, and provide reasons for their decisions. In
duty-based societies, these skills reinforce and transmit the authority
of tradition. In autonomy-based societies, they foster participation and
deliberation among citizens. The notable exception among the thinkers
discussed is Machiavelli, who permits deception in diplomacy, but only
in contexts where relations with other rulers resemble a state of war.
