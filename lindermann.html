<h1>Hilde Lindermann<a class="headerlink" href="#hilde-lindermann" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Hilde Lindemann (born in 1950) is an American philosopher and
bioethicist renowned for her work on feminist ethics, narrative ethics,
and relational approaches to moral philosophy. She has focused on the
intersection of ethics, identity, and social justice, emphasizing how
our relationships and social contexts shape moral obligations.</p>
<p>Her works on ethics include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>An Invitation to Feminist Ethics</strong>. This collection contains
Lindemann’s framing essay on feminist approaches to moral theory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Holding and Letting Go: The Social Practice of Personal
Identities:</strong> The book explores the ethical practice of “holding”
identities in relationships, and the responsibility to sustain or
release them when appropriate.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="relational-continuity">
<h2>Relational continuity<a class="headerlink" href="#relational-continuity" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Lindemann argues that the morality of an action depends on whether it
sustains the continuity of relationships between people.</p>
<p>Relationships are shaped through <strong>lived experiences</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Repeated interactions:</strong> Daily routines, caregiving, conversations,
and shared challenges that build mutual understanding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mutual responsiveness:</strong> Attending to one another’s needs,
emotions, and reactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Negotiation and adaptation:</strong> Working through conflicts,
compromises, and adjustments to define and fulfill obligations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Storytelling and reflection:</strong> Sharing experiences and reflecting
on the past, which codifies understanding and creates shared moral
norms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As relationships evolve, they accumulate a history of interactions. Over
time, partners learn patterns of behavior, build trust, and gain insight
into each other’s preferences and values. This knowledge forms a
foundation of shared understanding and mutual expectations, which
together create a <strong>relational identity</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Relational continuity</strong> refers to the smooth development of the
relational identity through stages that are perceived to be coherently
connected by all partners. When continuity is preserved, individuals
feel recognized, respected, and cared for, and trust grows stronger over
time. By contrast, breaking continuity erodes trust and may be
experienced as betrayal or abandonment. Continuity can take different
forms: it may involve preserving familiar patterns, adapting roles as
circumstances shift, or, at times, letting go of the relationship
responsibly. What matters morally is that such transitions are managed
through recognition and responsiveness.</p>
<p>Preserving relational continuity is a moral act, an expression of
respect for one’s partner and a commitment to the shared identity. It is
maintained through:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Attending to the other’s needs, emotions, and
cues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency:</strong> Fulfilling expectations reliably and showing up over
time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recognition:</strong> Affirming the other as the same person with whom one
shares a history, even amid changing circumstances (e.g., illness).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adaptation:</strong> Adjusting roles and responsibilities as the
relationship develops (e.g., an adult child caring for an aging
parent).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communication:</strong> Sustaining togetherness through shared stories,
affirmations, and dialogue.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely, continuity is broken by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Neglect:</strong> Ignoring the other’s needs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Betrayal:</strong> Violating trust through broken promises or actions that
disregard dignity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Objectification:</strong> Reducing the other to a task, burden, or
abstract “case” rather than treating them as a partner.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abrupt withdrawal:</strong> Ending contact or failing to honor the shared
history.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disregarding narrative identity:</strong> Ignoring the embedded history
and treating the relationship as if it had no past.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="dependency-and-agency">
<h2>Dependency and Agency<a class="headerlink" href="#dependency-and-agency" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Dependency</strong> arises when one person relies on another for support,
care, or well-being. It is a natural aspect of many relationships, such
as those between parents and children, caregivers and patients, or
mentors and mentees.</p>
<p><strong>Agency</strong> is the capacity to act intentionally, make choices, and
influence outcomes. Even when someone is partially dependent, they
retain some degree of agency: the ability to express preferences, make
decisions, or assert autonomy.</p>
<p>When a relationship involves dependency, it is ethically important to
respect both partners’ choices and capacities, even in moments of
vulnerability. Moral responsibility lies in balancing two demands:
addressing the dependent partner’s needs while also upholding their
agency as much as possible. The <strong>continuity</strong> of the relationship
becomes the central ethical measure, with morality judged by how well
this balance maintains connection and mutual recognition.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Parent–child:</strong> The child relies on the parent for care, yet
expresses preferences and learns decision-making; the parent responds
by guiding without overcontrolling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Friendship:</strong> A friend may rely on support during a crisis but
chooses whether to confide or accept help; the other friend respects
timing, privacy, and willingness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Doctor–patient:</strong> The patient depends on medical care yet consents
to treatment; the doctor ensures safety while respecting informed
consent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mentorship–mentee:</strong> The mentee depends on guidance but decides how
to act on advice; the mentor offers feedback while allowing
independent judgment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Romantic partnership:</strong> One partner may rely on emotional,
practical, or financial support; the other respects boundaries and
negotiates compromises to preserve autonomy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neighbors:</strong> Occasional reliance for assistance is balanced by
respecting privacy; help is offered when possible but without
overstepping.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="from-situated-experiences-to-habits">
<h2>From situated experiences to habits<a class="headerlink" href="#from-situated-experiences-to-habits" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Every interaction in a relationship, whether routine or extraordinary,
contributes to a shared record of experience and forms habits and
expectations. Over time, these experiences do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>teach each person what to expect from the other.</p></li>
<li><p>establish patterns of response.</p></li>
<li><p>form an implicit moral grammar that guides the relationship.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Parent–child relationship:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Lived experiences</em>: A parent consistently comforts the child
during nightmares, attends school events, and listens to worries.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Expectations</em>: The child expects protection and emotional
support, while the parent expects trust, affection, and respect.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Friendship:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Lived experiences</em>: Friends share confidences, celebrate
successes, and support one another through hardships.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Expectations</em>: Each friend expects loyalty, reliability, and
confidentiality, as well as a balance between giving and receiving
support.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Doctor–Patient Relationship:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Lived experiences</em>: Repeated visits in which the doctor listens
carefully, respects confidentiality, and explains treatment
options clearly.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Expectations</em>: The patient expects trust, privacy, attentive
listening, and honest advice, while the doctor expects disclosure
of relevant information and cooperation.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Workplace Mentorship:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Lived experiences:</em> A mentor provides constructive feedback,
advocates for opportunities, and models professional integrity.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Expectations:</em> The mentee expects guidance, honesty, and
reliability; the mentor expects effort, receptiveness, and
professionalism.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Romantic Partnership:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Lived experiences:</em> Partners share daily routines, resolve
conflicts with care, and affirm one another through affection and
support.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Expectations:</em> Partners expect fidelity, emotional availability,
and respect, as well as conflict resolution within the framework
of loyalty and love.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Neighborly Relationship:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Lived experiences:</em> Neighbors greet each other, help with small
tasks (such as collecting mail), and look out for one another’s
safety.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Expectations:</em> Neighbors expect civility, fairness, and
occasional helpfulness, along with respect for boundaries and
property.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<section id="universal-rules">
<h2>Universal rules<a class="headerlink" href="#universal-rules" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Lindemann argues that ethics is grounded in preserving the continuity of
relationships through lived experiences, rather than in the application
of abstract rules. However, <strong>rule</strong> are not irrelevant, they are useful
when understood in the context of the relationship. Their value lies in
how they support, clarify, or safeguard continuity.</p>
<p>Why rules remain useful:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Providing a framework for reflection:</strong> Relationships are complex,
emotional, and often unpredictable. In difficult moments, abstract
principles (such as respect autonomy) can provide orientation when
relational instincts feel unclear.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Guarding against blind spots:</strong> Embedded histories can foster bias
or neglect. Rules remind us of broader ethical standards that
counteract harmful relational patterns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Offering shared language:</strong> Rules supply a common vocabulary for
discussing relational tensions and for articulating why certain
actions threaten continuity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Structuring institutions that support continuity:</strong> Many
relationships, doctor–patient, teacher–student, mentor–mentee, are
embedded in institutions. Ethical codes formalize expectations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acting as safeguards under stress:</strong> When emotions run high, people
may act impulsively in ways that damage relationships. Rules provide
guardrails that protect continuity in fragile moments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preventing unjust termination:</strong> Rules establish minimum
obligations that must be honored before a relationship can end or be
redefined.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Illustrative examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Respect for autonomy:</strong> A teenager seeks more independence, but the
parent continues to treat them as a small child. Invoking autonomy,
the parent reflects: “My child has the right to make some decisions.”
This shift from control to guidance preserves care while allowing the
relationship to evolve into a more balanced family relationship.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fairness and reciprocity:</strong> One friend dominates conversations,
leaving the other feeling unheard. The overlooked friend appeals to
fairness: “Our friendship should be mutual, not just about you.” The
principle articulates the imbalance and opens space for repair.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Informed consent:</strong> A doctor dismisses a patient’s preferences,
assuming they “know best.” The rule of informed consent requires the
doctor to involve the patient in decisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Professional responsibility:</strong> A mentor frequently cancels
meetings, leaving the mentee unsupported. The mentee invokes
professional standards, reminding the mentor that guidance is part of
their role.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Respect for boundaries:</strong> One partner feels smothered by constant
demands for attention, while the other feels neglected when space is
requested. Clarifying boundaries and expectations improves the
relationship through healthier mutual respect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Respect for rights:</strong> A neighbor repeatedly blocks another’s
driveway, insisting it is “just temporary.” The affected neighbor
appeals to fairness and property rights, framing the issue as one of
mutual respect.</p></li>

<section id="virtues">
<h2>Virtues<a class="headerlink" href="#virtues" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The virtues can be regarded as moral because they nurture and contribute
to the preservation of relational continuity</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Humility:</strong> Allows one to acknowledge limitations and mistakes,
making space for forgiveness and repair. Prevents domination or
arrogance, which could fracture mutual recognition. Strengthens
adaptability by prioritizing the relationship over ego.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kindness:</strong> Nurtures trust through everyday acts of care and
attentiveness. Reinforces responsiveness, showing the other they are
valued and seen. Softens conflicts, enabling smoother adaptation
during challenges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Patience:</strong> Provides stability during times of frustration, change,
or slow growth in the relationship. Allows for repeated interactions
to unfold without haste or resentment. Sustains consistency and
resilience in the face of difficulties.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diligence:</strong> Demonstrates commitment by showing up reliably and
fulfilling responsibilities. Upholds consistency, which is central to
preserving trust and shared identity. Ensures responsiveness does not
fade over time due to neglect or complacency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Charity:</strong> Grounds the relationship in self-giving concern for the
other’s good. Motivates adaptation for the sake of the shared
relationship. Enriches storytelling and reflection, creating a
history of generosity and shared meaning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Temperance:</strong> Regulates impulses that could disrupt trust. Protects
continuity by preventing behaviors that might fracture respect or
recognition. Enables balanced negotiation and compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chastity:</strong> Honors the dignity of the other, ensuring they are
never objectified. Preserves continuity by safeguarding trust in
contexts of intimacy and fidelity. Encourages responsible adaptation
of relational roles without betrayal.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="inclusion">
<h2>Inclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#inclusion" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Inclusion</strong> refers to practices and attitudes that ensure individuals
and groups are recognized, respected, and allowed to participate fully
in social, institutional, and relational life. It is the opposite of
exclusion, which marginalizes or silences people by denying them
recognition, opportunities, or belonging.</p>
<p>Inclusion involves:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Recognition:</strong> seeing someone as a full moral agent with a voice
and identity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Participation:</strong> ensuring that their perspectives and needs are
taken into account in decisions and practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equity:</strong> providing fair conditions so that differences (e.g.,
disability, gender, culture) do not lead to disadvantage or
marginalization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Relational continuity</strong> does not exist in isolation; it is always
embedded within broader social contexts. In this sense, inclusion is
critical because the ability of partners to sustain relational
continuity can be influenced by external actors. When external actors,
such as institutions, social groups, or authorities, deny inclusion,
they create pressures that the partners must navigate. The partners are
now required to respond to expectations that may conflict with the
internal patterns, history, and continuity of their relationships.</p>
<p>Therefore, inclusion is a moral act because it enables the active
preservation of relational continuity, allowing partners to hold one
another’s identities with care and responsiveness.</p>
<p>Examples of inclusion:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Grandparent–grandchild:</strong> A community center provides translation
services so a grandparent who speaks a different language can attend
a grandchild’s school play. The grandparent–grandchild relationship
is included and reinforced through the shared experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Caregivers:</strong> hospital has a patient recovering from surgery whose
primary caregiver is their adult child. Instead of limiting medical
updates to “spouses only,” the hospital recognizes the adult child as
the key caregiver and includes them in medical consultations and care
planning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of exclusion:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Romantic partnership:</strong> During a hospital stay, only “immediate
family” is permitted visitation, excluding a long-term unmarried
partner. The exclusion undermines the couple’s shared history and
care practices, forcing the included partner to choose between
honoring the relationship and complying with institutional norms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Workplace exclusion:</strong> An employee is repeatedly left out of
after-work gatherings due to assumptions about their lifestyle.
Informal bonds with colleagues fail to develop, damaging the trust
and mutual recognition necessary for professional collaboration.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="lindermann-moral-guidelines">
<h2>Lindermann moral guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#lindermann-moral-guidelines" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>For those seeking to apply Lindermann ethics, this list provides
practical guidelines for putting Lindermanns’s principles into practice.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Prioritize relationships:</strong> Schedule regular time to connect with
family, friends, and community. Make decisions with the impact on
your relationships in mind. Check in with people affected by your
choices and ask how they feel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understand context:</strong> Gather background information before making
moral or professional decisions. Consider cultural norms, social
pressures, and personal circumstances. Avoid one-size-fits-all
solutions; tailor actions to the specific situation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Honor personal identity:</strong> Respect others’ self-descriptions,
pronouns, and chosen lifestyles. Support people in expressing
themselves authentically. Reflect on how your own identity affects
your ethical judgments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Listen to narratives:</strong> Encourage people to share their stories
before judging or acting. Practice active listening: focus fully,
avoid interrupting, and summarize understanding. Use narratives to
understand motivations, challenges, and moral implications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Care and empathy:</strong> Ask yourself: “What would it feel like to be in
their position?” Offer support through acts of kindness, attention,
or advocacy. Make care a deliberate part of daily routines, not just
emergencies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenge abstraction:</strong> Apply ethical principles to real
situations rather than treating them as rigid rules. Consider
concrete outcomes and practical consequences of decisions. Use case
studies or personal experiences to test moral reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recognize social power dynamics:</strong> Identify who holds power in
situations and how it affects fairness. Advocate for marginalized
voices in conversations, policies, or workplaces. Reflect on how your
own position may influence ethical choices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Engage in mutual responsibility:</strong> Collaborate on decisions that
affect shared spaces or communities. Take accountability for mistakes
and repair relationships when harmed. Encourage dialogue about shared
obligations and collective goals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Foster inclusion:</strong> Invite diverse perspectives and genuinely
consider them in decision-making. Challenge exclusionary practices in
your environment. Support initiatives that amplify underrepresented
voices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Balance holding and letting go:</strong> Offer guidance or support without
imposing control. Recognize when to step back to allow autonomy and
growth. Reflect on when intervention is helpful versus overbearing.</p></li>
