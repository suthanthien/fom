 Prof. Kristján Kristjánsson
****************************

Author of *Virtues and Vices in Positive Psychology: A Philosophical
Critique* (Cambridge University Press, 2013). Reading this book inspired
me to reflect on the foundations of morality and marked my first
introduction to Aristotle's stages of virtue. The account that full
virtue is characterised by harmony between actions and emotions is taken
from his book.
