 Perter Drucker
################

Peter F. Drucker (1909–2005) was one of the most influential management
thinkers of the twentieth century and is widely regarded as the father
of modern management. He was born in Vienna, Austria, into an
intellectually active household that shaped his lifelong interest in
social institutions and responsibility. Drucker later became an
economist, social theorist, author, and professor in the United States.

Unlike many management scholars who focused primarily on efficiency or
strategy, Drucker consistently framed management as a profession with
ethical obligations. For him, management and leadership were not merely
technical skills but moral practices grounded in responsibility,
judgment, and integrity.

Drucker did not write a single standalone “ethics textbook,” but ethical
reasoning is deeply embedded throughout his major works:

-  **The Practice of Management (1954):** Introduced the idea that
   management is a social function with public responsibilities, not
   just a profit-making activity.

-  **The Effective Executive (1967):** Emphasized personal
   responsibility, integrity, and decision-making grounded in
   predictable consequences.

-  **Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices (1973):** Explicitly
   framed management as a moral discipline, arguing that managers are
   trustees of social institutions.

-  **What Is Business Ethics? (1981):** One of Drucker’s most direct
   treatments of ethics, where he rejected fashionable ethical theories
   and proposed a practical ethics centered on responsibility and “doing
   no harm.”

-  **Post-Capitalist Society (1993):** Explored ethical challenges
   arising from knowledge work, power, and social legitimacy in modern
   organizations.

 Managers
**********

For Drucker, the role of the manager is to temporarily administer
institutions. Managers are stewards whose responsibility is to ensure
the continuity, effectiveness, and legitimacy of the organization beyond
the tenure of any individual leader. They delegate authority wisely to
employees and other stakeholders in order to safeguard the institution’s
long-term viability. Their purpose is to serve during the time they are
entrusted with leadership and never to prioritize personal gain over the
integrity of the institution.

From these premises, Drucker articulates a form of professional ethics
that converges with ethical insights developed in other professions and
historical contexts. These parallels reflect similar moral responses to
the exercise of power, responsibility, and trust:

-  In a manner analogous to Mozi, Drucker treats power as inseparable
   from **responsibility**. Because managerial decisions can affect
   livelihoods, communities, and social trust, managers bear a
   heightened moral burden. Drucker grounds this responsibility in
   professional competence and institutional impact. Good intentions are
   insufficient; careful study of managerial practice and development of
   expertise are required to anticipate the institutional and social
   consequences of decisions.

-  In line with the Hippocratic principle of **“do no harm,”** Drucker
   argues that institutions must, at a minimum, avoid causing damage to
   individuals, society, or the social fabric that sustains them.
   Harmful conduct, whether legal or profitable, undermines legitimacy,
   invites resistance or regulation, and may ultimately threaten the
   institution’s survival. Managers must also avoid harming trust, which
   Drucker regarded as the institution’s most valuable and fragile
   asset.

-  Echoing virtue-based traditions, Drucker stresses the importance of
   character in professional roles, particularly the virtue of
   **integrity**. A manager who disregards rules or takes ethical
   shortcuts in pursuit of personal or short-term success teaches that
   individual performance matters more than responsible institutional
   outcomes. Over time, this corrodes trust, morale, and effectiveness.
   Ethical leadership therefore operates through visible example, as
   employees shape their behavior around what leaders tolerate and
   reward.

-  Converging with Kantian respect for human **dignity**, Drucker
   insists that people must not be treated merely as means. Drucker
   grounds dignity in the practical realities of modern organizations,
   which depend on knowledge, judgment, and commitment rather than mere
   obedience. When dignity is disregarded, people withdraw
   responsibility and engagement. When work is meaningful and
   individuals understand their contribution, they are able to take
   responsibility for results and perform at their best.

 Drucker's ethical guidelines
******************************

-  **Take responsibility for results:** Before major decisions,
   explicitly ask who will be affected and how. Track the real
   consequences of decisions after implementation. Publicly acknowledge
   mistakes and take corrective action.

-  **Do no harm:** Assess whether decisions create hidden costs for
   employees, customers, or society. Refuse strategies that rely on
   deception or unsafe practices. Stop or redesign initiatives once
   harmful effects become visible.

-  **Exercise power as stewardship:** Use authority to enable others
   rather than control them. Share information that allows responsible
   decision-making at lower levels. Regularly ask whether decisions
   strengthen the institution beyond your tenure.

-  **Do not promote people who lack integrity:** Evaluate candidates on
   ethical behavior, not just results. Investigate patterns of
   misconduct or rule-bending before promotion. Be willing to slow
   advancement rather than compromise leadership standards.

-  **Respect the dignity of every worker:** Involve employees in
   decisions affecting their work. Provide honest feedback without
   humiliation or coercion. Ensure fair treatment in pay, workload, and
   opportunity.

-  **Create meaningful and responsible work:** Define clear
   responsibilities and expected contributions. Connect individual roles
   to the organization’s purpose. Allow autonomy where professional
   judgment is required.

-  **Balance performance with responsibility:** Set performance targets
   that are demanding but realistic. Reject incentives that reward
   results achieved through unethical means. Review not only what was
   achieved, but how it was achieved.

-  **Serve the institution before serving yourself:** Avoid decisions
   that benefit your career but harm the organization. Develop
   successors rather than making yourself indispensable. Step aside when
   another leader is better suited for the role.

-  **Preserve trust:** Communicate honestly, even when information is
   incomplete. Keep commitments or renegotiate them openly when
   circumstances change. Address breaches of trust quickly and visibly.

-  **Reject ethical relativism:** Apply the same ethical standards
   across teams and geographies. Resist “everyone does it”
   justifications. Encourage ethical dissent and protect those who raise
   concerns.

-  **Think long-term:** Evaluate decisions over multi-year horizons.
   Invest in people, systems, and culture even when returns are delayed.
   Push back against stakeholders demanding unethical shortcuts.

-  **Ensure legitimacy through ethical conduct:** Monitor how the
   organization is perceived by employees and society. Align business
   practices with stated values and mission.

-  **Lead by example:** Model the behavior you expect from others. Apply
   ethical standards to yourself before enforcing them on others.
