 Adam Smith
############

Adam Smith (1723–1790) was a Scottish philosopher and political
economist, widely regarded as one of the central figures of the Scottish
Enlightenment. Although he is best known today as the “father of
economics” for his work on markets and capitalism, Smith considered
himself first and foremost a moral philosopher. His ethical theory laid
the foundation for his later economic ideas and remains influential in
moral, political, and social philosophy.

Adam Smith’s primary works on ethics are:

-  **The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759):** This book is Smith’s main
   ethical treatise and went through six editions during his lifetime.
   It explores the nature of moral judgment, sympathy, virtue, and
   social order.

-  **An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations
   (1776):** While focused on economics, this work presupposes the moral
   framework developed in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, particularly
   ideas about self-interest, justice, and social cooperation.

 Merchants

According to Adam Smith, the primary role of a merchant is to trade. By
connecting resources with those who need them, merchants not only enrich
themselves but also contribute, often unintentionally, to the **welfare
of society**. Through commerce, new activities and new forms of
well-being emerge, improving the quality of life more broadly. Although
Smith does not require benevolent intentions from merchants, he shows
how their pursuit of private interest can generate public benefit under
appropriate moral and institutional conditions.

Smith recognises self-interest as a powerful motivator of commercial
activity. At the same time, he maintains that the pursuit of profit is
constrained by **moral judgment** and social approval. While Smith does
not frame this explicitly as a virtue ethic, his account invites an
Aristotelian reading: commendable commercial conduct lies between the
extremes of unrestrained greed and total self-denial for the sake of
others. Merchants are thus implicitly encouraged to exercise moderation
in their pursuit of gain.

Smith argues that merchants seek profit within the bounds of what
society considers fair and proportional. **Approval** depends on whether
gains are perceived as reasonable relative to risk, effort, and
contribution. Moderate profits secured through fair dealing tend to
sustain a merchant’s reputation over time. By contrast, excessive or
predatory gains invite resentment and often provoke social or political
responses that ultimately restrict the merchant’s freedom to trade.
According to Smith, these outcomes are predictable social consequences
of overreaching self-interest.

To sustain a shared perception of fairness, Smith’s moral framework
implies that merchants must cultivate an understanding of value and
risk, both for themselves and for those with whom they trade. Although
Smith does not explicitly assign merchants a pedagogical role, his
emphasis on sympathy, **transparency**, and **informed judgment**
implies a practical discipline: merchants must learn to assess prices,
terms, risks and how these factors are likely to be understood by their
trading partners, and to communicate these elements openly so that
agreement rests on shared comprehension. Merchants who communicate
openly reduce friction in transactions and attract durable trading
relationships. Conversely, deception undermines sympathy and corrodes
the basis of cooperation. Once trust is lost, customers either withdraw
or insist on costly safeguards, making exchange more difficult for all
parties.

Smith acknowledges that judgments of fairness are easily distorted by
self-interest. To counter this tendency, he introduces a method of moral
self-assessment. Merchants are encouraged to imagine themselves as
**“impartial spectators”** observing their own conduct from a detached
standpoint. If a transaction appears acceptable from this perspective,
it is likely to be just. This exercise does not guarantee moral
correctness, but it provides a practical discipline for restraining
biased judgment in commercial life.

Taken together, Smith’s account encourages merchants to value
**long-term reputation** over short-term profit, even under the pressure
of competition. This priority emerges from Smith’s analysis of how moral
sentiments, social approval, and self-interest interact over time.

 Commerce and law
******************

As a thinker of the Enlightenment, Smith places **justice** at the
foundation of social order and argues that it must never be violated in
the pursuit of profit. Commerce depends on trust, contracts, and stable
expectations. Acts of injustice, such as fraud, coercion, or breach of
contract, destroy trust and generate resentment. The resulting distrust,
punishment, or retaliation increases the burdens of future exchange and
undermines the merchant’s capacity to trade. The long-term effect is a
deterioration of outcomes for both the merchant and society as a whole.

Smith also warns that when merchants hold **political power**, they
should refrain from using public office to advance their private
commercial interests. Such abuses provoke public resentment and weaken
the legitimacy of both markets and political institutions. Even from the
merchant’s own perspective, the erosion of public trust ultimately
compromises the conditions necessary for sustained commerce.

Finally, Smith is strongly critical of **collusion and monopoly**
formation among merchants. He argues that when merchants conspire to
limit competition, they keep markets artificially understocked and raise
prices above their natural level, enriching a few at the direct expense
of the many. Such practices provoke public resentment, as consumers
recognise that they are being made to pay more not because of scarcity
or risk, but because competition has been suppressed. Smith further
warns that monopolies are rarely sustained without the aid of political
privilege, and that merchants often seek to bend laws and regulations to
secure exclusive advantages, thereby corrupting legislation and
undermining justice. Beyond these social and political harms, monopoly
dulls the discipline of competition that ordinarily promotes diligence,
innovation, and efficiency. Shielded from rivals, merchants become
complacent, neglect improvement, and supply inferior goods. Over time,
these practices harm even the monopolists themselves by eroding their
capacity to innovate, adapt, and compete once protective barriers weaken
or disappear.

 Adam Smith's ethical guidelines
*********************************

-  **Respect justice:** Refuse transactions that require deception,
   coercion, or concealment of material facts. Ensure contracts are
   understandable to all parties, not just legally defensible. Treat
   suppliers, customers, and employees according to the same standards
   you would accept for yourself. Exit markets or practices that depend
   on systematic harm, even if they are legal.

-  **Discipline self-interest:** Before major decisions, ask: "Would a
   fair outsider approve of this profit?" Create personal or
   organizational rules that restrict opportunistic behavior. Accept
   reduced margins rather than compromise moral standards.

-  **Avoid monopoly and collusion:** Decline informal agreements with
   competitors on prices, territories, or output. Support industry
   standards that increase transparency. Speak against collusive
   practices within professional associations.

-  **Commit to truthfulness and transparency:** Represent product
   quality, origin, and limitations accurately. Disclose relevant risks,
   fees, and terms clearly and early. Train staff to prioritize honesty
   over sales targets. Correct errors publicly and promptly when
   misinformation occurs.

-  **Resist political manipulation:** Avoid lobbying for regulations
   that protect you from competition. Do not seek subsidies, tariffs, or
   privileges that burden consumers or rivals. Separate business
   advocacy from public-interest claims unless they align genuinely.
   Support fair, general rules rather than industry-specific advantages.

-  **Prioritize long-term reputation over short-term gain:** Evaluate
   decisions by their impact on trust over years. Build relationships
   based on reliability and fairness. Reward employees for ethical
   behavior, not just financial performance.

-  **Consider social consequences of commercial actions:** Assess how
   pricing, sourcing, or automation affects communities and workers.
   Adjust practices when unintended harm becomes evident. Recognize
   moral responsibility for large-scale effects.

-  **Internalize moral judgment:** Regularly review decisions from the
   perspective of customers, employees, and the public. Encourage
   dissent and ethical questioning. Conduct ethical audits alongside
   financial ones.
