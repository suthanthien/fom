 Amartya Sen
#############

Amartya Kumar Sen (1933–2023) was an Indian economist and moral
philosopher whose work transformed welfare economics, development
studies, and political philosophy. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial
Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare
economics and social choice theory.

Sen’s ethical outlook was shaped by his early experience of the Bengal
Famine of 1943, which revealed how mass suffering can result from
political and administrative failures rather than resource scarcity.
Drawing on Indian philosophical traditions and Western thinkers such as
Aristotle, Adam Smith, and John Rawls, Sen consistently argued that
ethical reasoning is inseparable from public decision-making.

Sen’s ethical contributions are embedded across his economic and
philosophical writings:

-  **Collective Choice and Social Welfare (1970):** Revived social
   choice theory and explored the ethical aggregation of individual
   preferences in public decisions.

-  **On Economic Inequality (1973):** Critiqued income-focused
   approaches to justice and highlighted moral questions of fairness and
   distribution.

-  **Poverty and Famines (1981):** Demonstrated that famines result from
   failures of governance and entitlements, not merely food shortages.

-  **Commodities and Capabilities (1985):** Introduced the capability
   approach, focusing on what individuals are able to do and be.

-  **Ethics and Economics (1987):** Explicitly challenged the separation
   of economic analysis from moral philosophy.

-  **Inequality Reexamined (1992):** Developed a plural,
   capability-based framework for evaluating justice.

-  **Development as Freedom (1999):** Reconceived development as the
   expansion of substantive human freedoms.

-  **Rationality and Freedom (2002):** Explored ethical reasoning,
   agency, and the nature of choice.

-  **The Idea of Justice (2009):** Presented a comparative, practical
   approach to justice, rejecting idealized institutional perfection.

 Freedom-enabling administration
*********************************

Sen argues that the role of political institutions, and of those who
govern them, is to **expand people’s real freedoms**. By real freedom,
he means not merely formal rights, but the substantive ability to live
in ways one has reason to value. Real freedom involves both the
opportunity to reflect on what matters in life and the ability to act on
their rational reflections. This idea is closely linked to capability: a
person is truly free if they have the capability to make choices and act
on them in the world. Among the many capabilities that constitute real
freedom, Sen highlights two are fundamental. The first is the ability to
meet basic material needs, ensuring freedom from deprivation. The second
is the ability to participate in social life on terms comparable to
others, enabling freedom to meaningfully engage with society.

Sen is especially attentive to the constraints imposed by factors such
as health conditions, disability, gender, and social discrimination. For
individuals facing such disadvantages, equality of resources does not
translate into **equality of freedom**: given the same resources, more
advantaged individuals are often able to convert them into a wider range
of freedom-enabling capabilities. Therefore, moral institutions should
aim to expand opportunities in proportion to individuals’ disadvantages.

A failure to address freedom inequalities constitutes a serious moral
shortcoming of political arrangements. Freedom inequalities can expose
disadvantaged groups to acute vulnerability, particularly in contexts
such as food insecurity or public health crises, where individuals may
lack the means to respond effectively on their own. Sen emphasizes that
expanding people’s capabilities to act and to secure their basic needs
**enhances both their agency and their resilience**. Strengthening these
capabilities is ethically preferable to policies that merely respond to
crises after they arise.

Sen further contends that freedom cannot be adequately assessed through
self-reported happiness or utility. Because preferences and aspirations
adapt to circumstances of deprivation, individuals who are subject to
persistent injustice may nevertheless report satisfaction. For this
reason, assessments of justice must look beyond reported emotions and
examine the actual opportunities people have to achieve a life they have
reason to value. Therefore, institutional design must focus on creating
the opportunities and support that **allow individuals to reflect and
discover what they value and exercise agency in pursuit of their
choices**.

Similar to how Nishida recognized that multiple perspectives can
coexist, Sen highlights the plurality of values in social life.
Individuals may reasonably prioritize freedom, equality, dignity,
security, or other goods, and no single value can fully subsume the
others. Political judgment therefore, involves navigating trade-offs
among considerations that cannot be measured or ranked on a single
scale: for many decisions, no single best solution exists. Hence, the
task of institutions is not to achieve perfect solutions, but to
**implement arrangements that are comparatively more just than the
alternatives available**. Sen distinguishes between ideal justice, which
serves as a guiding benchmark, and comparative justice, which informs
practical policymaking. Lawmaking is thus an ongoing process of
incremental improvement, attentive to historical context and the lived
experiences of the communities it serves.

For Sen, **democratic participation** in civic life is a fundamental
requirement of justice. It is intrinsically valuable as an expression of
political freedom, and instrumentally valuable as a means of preventing
economic failures and safeguarding other freedoms. Indeed, by
incorporating diverse perspectives and knowledge, inclusive public
reasoning helps reduce informational blind spots, correct biases, and
increase the likelihood that decisions are comparatively better than
their predecessors.

Sen also rejects strongly paternalistic approaches to law that replace
the judgment of citizens with that of institutions. While public policy
inevitably shapes incentives and opportunities, the aim of just
government is to **enable individuals to exercise agency**. In this
respect, Sen’s emphasis on agency bears similarity with Dewey’s
pragmatic ethics, particularly the view that social institutions,
including education, should cultivate the capacities for deliberation,
cooperation, and problem-solving that democratic life requires.

Those involved in policymaking **bear responsibility for the foreseeable
consequences of their decisions**. This requires attentiveness to
empirical knowledge, including economic analysis. Yet, concepts such as
efficiency, welfare, and rationality are not value-neutral; they embed
evaluative judgments that must be examined through public reasoning.
Technical expertise is therefore necessary but not sufficient: it must
be integrated with ethical reflection and democratic scrutiny.

Finally, Sen insists that considerations of **justice extend beyond the
boundaries of the nation-state**. Global interdependence implies that
policies should be assessed not only by their domestic effects but also
by their impact on the freedoms of others elsewhere. Expanding freedom
in one society at the unjust expense of another is incompatible with
Sen's capability-based account of justice.

 Virtues
*********

These are dispositions that, in light of Sen’s work on justice and
capabilities, would support effective and ethical public administration:

-  **Practical Wisdom:** Deliberate and reflective reasoning is
   essential for sound moral and policy decisions. Policymakers consider
   long-term outcomes, anticipate unintended effects, and use empirical
   evidence alongside ethical judgment.

-  **Justice:** Justice involves expanding freedom-enabling
   capabilities, not merely distributing resources or following rules.
   Policymakers design institutions to reduce disadvantage, expand
   opportunities, and ensure that laws and policies improve comparative
   justice for all citizens.

-  **Courage:** Justice often requires sustaining policies and
   institutional reforms that withstand political pressure and social
   disagreement. Policymakers remain committed to addressing manifest
   injustices, especially those affecting marginalized groups, even when
   such efforts face resistance, grounding their actions in publicly
   defensible reasons.

-  **Honesty:** Policies and decisions must be transparent and
   accountable. Policymakers ensure truthful communication, maintain
   transparency, take responsibility for consequences, and engage in
   rigorous ethical reflection.

-  **Humility:** Policymakers and citizens must recognize that no single
   perspective captures the full complexity of justice. They acknowledge
   the limits of technical expertise and predictive models when
   designing policy.

-  **Kindness**: Policymakers take seriously the lived experiences of
   deprivation, suffering, and disadvantage, and allow these realities
   to inform institutional priorities and policy design. Attention to
   how policies affect the worst-off guides efforts in health,
   education, social protection, and political inclusion, with the aim
   of expanding people’s substantive freedoms.

-  **Patience:** Social change and the expansion of capabilities take
   time; justice is often a process. Policymakers support gradual
   reforms that expand freedoms.

-  **Diligence:** Advancing freedom and justice requires sustained
   attention to how policies affect people’s actual capabilities.
   Policymakers continually evaluate outcomes using empirical evidence
   and public feedback, revise policies when they fail to reduce
   deprivation or expand opportunity.

 Sen's ethical guidelines
**************************

-  **Expand people’s capabilities:** Invest in public goods that
   strengthen long-term human functioning such as schools and hospitals.
   Remove freedom barriers such as discrimination, geographic isolation,
   bureaucratic exclusion. Design welfare programs that preserve choice
   and autonomy. Support education, skills, and participation.

-  **Prevent avoidable suffering:** Maintain early-warning systems for
   hunger, disease, and economic distress. Act proactively rather than
   waiting for statistical confirmation of crises.

-  **Encourage democratic participation:** Include affected communities
   in policy design. Publish clear explanations for major decisions and
   policy changes. Encourage independent media. Make participation
   accessible through language, technology, and physical means.

-  **Address injustice proactively:** Identify policies that cause clear
   harm even if they are part of traditions. Prioritize reforms that
   reduce suffering quickly, even if they only address only a part of
   suffering. Avoid paralysis caused by waiting for “perfect” solutions.

-  **Balance equality with freedom:** Ensure equality-enhancing policies
   do not undermine basic liberties. Balance competing values
   transparently. Allow flexibility in implementation across regions and
   cultures.

-  **Revise the outcome of your interventions** Monitor real-world
   effects of policies continuously. Be willing to revise or repeal
   harmful policies. Require impact assessments that measure effects on
   health, education, and dignity.

-  **Prefer reasoned persuasion:** Use education, incentives, and
   dialogue before mandates. Justify regulations with evidence and
   ethical reasoning. Limit coercive power to clearly necessary cases.

-  **Be mindful of concerns of the global community:** Support
   international cooperation on poverty, health, and education. Avoid
   policies that benefit one group by exporting harm elsewhere.
