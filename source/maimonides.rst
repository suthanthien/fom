 Maimonides
############

Moses Maimonides (1138–1204) was a medieval Jewish philosopher, legal
scholar, physician, and communal leader. Born in Córdoba, Spain, he
later lived in Morocco and Egypt, where he served as the leader of the
Jewish community. He is one of the most influential figures in Jewish
intellectual history.

While ethics appears throughout his writings, several key works directly
articulate his ethical thought:

-  **Commentary on the Mishnah (1168):** an introduction to his
   commentary on Pirkei Avot, summarizing philosophical and
   psychological foundations of ethics.

-  **Mishneh Torah (1177-1180):** A legal-philosophical code that sets
   out practical norms of ethical conduct, character development, and
   emotional health.

-  **The Guide of the Perplexed (1186–1190):** although primarily
   philosophical and theological, it contains extensive discussions of
   moral perfection, intellectual virtue, and the purpose of the
   commandments.

***********************
 Knowledge and virtues
***********************

Maimonides argues that the highest human end is the **perfection of the
intellect**, culminating in a refined **understanding of God** and of
the metaphysical order underlying creation. This intellectual perfection
constitutes the ultimate human aspiration, and an ethical life is a life
directed toward this highest aim.

For the mind to function properly, a person must cultivate ethical
**virtues**. Moral disorder, being ruled by impulses, appetites, and
passions, distorts perception and obstructs rational clarity. Ethical
virtues create psychological balance, allowing reason to govern and
opening the way for intellectual perfection.

Maimonides adopts Aristotle’s doctrine of the “golden mean,” according
to which virtues are ideal dispositions located between harmful
extremes. Aristotle holds that virtue is constitutive of human
flourishing and therefore inherently part of happiness in this life.
Maimonides, by contrast, treats the moral virtues as instrumental: they
prepare the soul for knowledge of God.

Unlike Aristotle, Maimonides suggests that a person may sometimes need
to adopt an extreme temporarily. If someone tends toward one extreme,
they may need to embrace the opposite extreme for a time in order to
counterbalance their tendencies and restore equilibrium, until they are
once again able to walk the golden mean reliably.

**************
 Commandments
**************

Traditionally, the Ten Commandments are understood as divine rules
revealed to guide human behavior. Over time, Jewish tradition expanded
and systematized the commandments, and by Maimonides’ era they had been
enumerated as 613.

For Maimonides, the commandments form a comprehensive system designed to
transform both character and intellect. They serve two primary purposes:

-  **The perfection of the body:** creating social order, cultivating
   virtuous habits, restraining passions, and fostering a stable, just
   society in which people can live peacefully and think clearly.

-  **The perfection of the soul:** eliminating idolatry and
   superstition, directing the mind toward truth, cultivating correct
   beliefs, and ultimately enabling the intellectual knowledge of God.

Drawing on themes found throughout the **Guide of the Perplexed** and
the **Mishneh Torah**, the commandments can be loosely grouped into
conceptual categories:

-  **Commandments of belief:** These orient the intellect toward truth
   and away from fantasy or superstition. Correct beliefs are
   foundational, because without true understanding, moral action
   becomes misguided. Examples include loving God and sanctifying God’s
   name.

-  **Moral character commandments:** These regulate emotions and desires
   so that reason can govern. Their aim is psychological balance, which
   allows for intellectual growth. Examples include avoiding resentment,
   not coveting, loving one’s neighbor as oneself, and honoring the
   elderly.

-  **Charity and social justice laws:** These reduce envy, violence, and
   greed: the passions that disrupt both society and individual
   judgment. Such laws establish a stable social environment, which
   Maimonides sees as essential for moral and intellectual development.
   Examples include giving charity, providing interest-free loans,
   establishing courts, and prohibiting theft, fraud, and oppression.

-  **Ritual commandments:** These discipline the imagination and
   emotions, cultivate self-control, and reinforce communal identity.
   Examples include prayer, Sabbaths and festivals, dietary laws, and
   the sacrificial system.

-  **Commandments of self-restraint:** These moderate physical desires
   and prevent excessive indulgence, which can cloud judgment and
   distract the intellect. They impose order on the appetites so that
   the rational faculty is not overwhelmed. Examples include
   prohibitions on certain foods, sexual relations, and excessive
   drinking or gluttony.

-  **Commandments of compassion and kindness:** These cultivate mercy
   and benevolence, traits that imitate God’s ways and elevate the soul
   above cruelty and anger. Examples include kindness to strangers,
   preventing animal suffering, and honoring parents.

-  **Commandments of Law and Government:** These establish political
   stability and social justice. Examples include laws of kingship,
   judicial procedures, and civil laws.

*****************
 Role of the law
*****************

For Maimonides, laws and justice play a crucial role in shaping moral
character and preparing people for intellectual perfection.

-  In a chaotic society, people are preoccupied with survival, and the
   accompanying fear, anger, and instability make it difficult to pursue
   truth. An atmosphere of external peace fosters internal peace, which
   in turn enables the perfection of the intellect.

-  Human beings achieve virtue within a community, and their character
   is molded by their social interactions. Good laws create an
   environment in which people are naturally habituated to virtuous
   behavior.

-  Good laws shape everyday conduct: how people speak, treat one
   another, conduct business, and resolve conflicts. Over time, these
   externally regulated behaviors form stable internal dispositions.

-  The legislator, Maimonides suggests, is like a physician. Just as a
   physician uses the right chemical remedies to restore physical
   balance, the legislator employs the right incentives and prohibitions
   to restore psychological balance within the community and guide
   people toward intellectual perfection.

Maimonides also emphasizes that good laws promote charity and the
protection of the vulnerable: they do not only improve material
conditions but they also cultivate people's healthy psychological
dispositions. Good laws foster empathy, and help form **a virtuous and
rational society**.

*********
 Virtues
*********

This is a list of virtues in Maimonides’ ethics, each understood as a
mean between two extremes. Maimonides makes two notable exceptions:
humility and patience. He allows leaning toward the extreme of humility
because pride easily corrupts a person’s character, and toward the
extreme of patience because anger so quickly disturbs judgment. In these
cases, avoiding the dangerous extreme is more important than maintaining
a perfect midpoint.

-  **Temperance:** moderate regulation of bodily appetites so they serve
   reason.

   -  *Excess:* self-indulgence, gluttony, uncontrolled desire.

   -  *Deficiency:* asceticism that harms the body or rejects natural
      pleasures.

   -  *Examples:* Eating moderately even at feasts. Sexual conduct
      governed by reason and Torah law. Enjoying permitted pleasures
      without becoming dependent on them.

-  **Humility:** correct appreciation of one’s abilities and place.

   -  *Excess:* arrogance, self-importance.
   -  *Deficiency:* self-abasement that leads to paralysis or
      self-neglect.
   -  *Examples:* Speaking modestly of one’s achievements. Giving others
      credit. Avoiding boastful behavior.

-  **Courage:** appropriate readiness to face danger or hardship when
   reason requires it.

   -  *Excess:* recklessness, unnecessary risk, seeking danger.
   -  *Deficiency:* cowardice, fearfulness that prevents action.
   -  *Examples:* Acting calmly in dangerous situations when duty
      requires. Protecting others. Enduring hardship.

-  **Generosity:** giving in proportion to need and to what reason
   judges right, without harming one’s ability to pursue intellectual
   ends.

   -  *Excess:* prodigality, giving so much that one becomes dependent
      on others.

   -  *Deficiency:* stinginess, refusing reasonable charity or
      assistance.

   -  *Examples:* Giving proportionate to income. Supporting community
      needs in a sustainable way. Sharing resources without
      impoverishing oneself.

-  **Patience:** controlled response to provocation, using reason to
   decide whether and how to react.

   -  *Excess:* uncontrollable anger, rage, fits of temper.

   -  *Deficiency:* total inability to feel anger even when morally
      required.

   -  *Examples:* Correcting others calmly. Allowing oneself to feel
      indignation only in controlled, purposeful ways. Maintaining
      emotional composure in conflict.

-  **Justice:** impartial, balanced treatment in accordance with law and
   reason.

   -  *Excess:* harshness, quick condemnation, rigid strictness.
   -  *Deficiency:* excessive leniency or refusal to judge when
      appropriate.
   -  *Examples:* Giving others the benefit of the doubt. Listening
      carefully before responding. Applying rules fairly.

-  **Truthfulness:** honesty tempered by wisdom, speaking truth when
   appropriate and avoiding harmful falsehoods.

   -  *Excess:* hurtful bluntness, truth-telling without compassion.
   -  *Deficiency:* habitual lying, deception, manipulative speech.
   -  *Examples:* Being honest in business. Avoiding false flattery.
      Telling the truth in a considerate way.

-  **Love of God:** measured, rational love of God expressed in pursuing
   knowledge of God and conforming life to that knowledge.

   -  *Excess*: fanaticism that abandons reason.

   -  *Deficiency:* indifference or apathy toward God and truth.

   -  *Examples:* sustained philosophical/theological study motivated by
      desire to know God. Worship insofar as it reinforces understanding
      and moral order.

 Maimonides' ethical guidelines
********************************

-  **Cultivate the “Golden Mean”:** Identify where you tend toward
   extremes. Set small, realistic behavioral goals to move closer to the
   middle. Keep a weekly journal noting when you acted with balance or
   imbalance. Ask trusted friends to point out when you’re leaning
   toward an extreme.

-  **Correct extreme traits through their opposite:** If you struggle
   with stinginess, deliberately practice generosity for a period. If
   you tend to anger, practice speaking softly and pausing before
   reacting. Continue the opposite behavior until you feel closer to the
   middle path.

-  **Develop habits:** Turn virtues into routines: schedule times for
   charity, study, or acts of kindness. Practice daily micro-habits.
   Celebrate consistency. Use reminders (calendars, phone alerts) to
   reinforce new patterns.

-  **Avoid acting in anger:** Never respond immediately when angry;
   impose a mandatory delay. Step away physically if possible; breathe
   until the spike fades. If you must correct someone, speak firmly
   without inner rage. Reflect afterward: What triggered me? What
   pattern am I seeing?

-  **Pursue humility:** Talk less about yourself; listen more.
   Acknowledge your mistakes without defensiveness. Practice gratitude:
   list daily what comes from others rather than from yourself. Let
   others take credit when appropriate; avoid seeking praise.

-  **Give charity with empathy and dignity:** Assume the recipient’s
   dignity: give discreetly and respectfully. Prioritize sustainable
   help (job support, skills, tools) when possible. Set aside a regular
   charity budget so giving becomes habitual. Support causes that
   restore independence, not dependency.

-  **Love and care for others as yourself:** Actively look for ways to
   help others: small kindnesses count. Avoid gossip and negative
   speech; speak truthfully and gently. Treat others’ emotional needs as
   seriously as your own. When interacting, ask: “How would I want to be
   treated in this moment?”

-  **Accept responsibility for your actions:** Say “I was wrong,” not “I
   was wrong but….” Identify patterns of avoidance and confront them
   directly. Establish clear personal rules and hold yourself
   accountable. Learn from mistakes rather than hiding them.

-  **Elevate ethical virtues to prepare for intellectual virtues:**
   Schedule time for study, reflection, or contemplation daily. Reduce
   distractions (excess entertainment, trivial pursuits). Clean up moral
   habits that hinder clarity (envy, anger, laziness). Approach study
   with humility, patience, and joy.
