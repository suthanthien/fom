 Conclusion

Across the thinkers examined in this chapter, despite differing
foundations, shared ethical elements emerge.

These thinkers generally agree on the principle that **greater power
entails greater responsibility**. Professionals possess skills and
knowledge that exceed those of most people, and they may apply these
abilities either for the benefit of society or for personal gain.
Professional ethics consistently calls for a commitment to the public
good, or, at minimum, a balanced position in which both societal
interests and personal interests are respected.

Some thinkers place self-interest at the center of professional
motivation and regard the welfare of the community as a practical
necessity: without concern for others, a professional’s success and
effectiveness would ultimately be undermined. Other thinkers define care
for others as the primary purpose of the professional role. Despite
these differences, both perspectives converge on a shared conclusion: a
professional’s capacity to function depends on the **trust granted by
society**. Consequently, all agree that this trust must be respected and
actively maintained through careful, competent, and ethical service.

From this standpoint, **technical expertise** itself becomes a moral
virtue. Mastery of one’s craft, continuous practice, and ongoing
self-improvement lead to reliable performance and trustworthy service.
While good intentions matter, outcomes are equally fundamental.
Professionals therefore regard excellence in practice as a moral
obligation.

In striving for improvement, they also recognize their responsibility to
**sustain the profession** beyond their own careers. Aware that their
mission transcends their individual existence, they prepare others to
continue the work. Through teaching, mentoring, coaching, and the
sharing of knowledge, they contribute to a professional environment in
which successors can operate effectively and harmoniously.

 Virtues
*********

Thinkers commonly encourage the cultivation of the following virtues and
behaviours:

-  **Humility:** Even when your skills surpass those of many others, you
   remain fallible. Continue studying your craft, compare your work with
   that of your peers, and seek feedback for improvement. Honor the
   knowledge and professional standing inherited from predecessors.
   Remain worthy of the trust placed in you, upon which your practice
   depends.

-  **Kindness:** Treat those you serve with dignity, recognizing them as
   moral agents with legitimate interests. Never exploit, deceive, or
   harm. Support the professional growth and success of others. Learn
   from those who surpass you, and honor their achievements.

-  **Patience:** Do not allow anger or fear to cloud your judgment. When
   wronged, address misconduct openly and invite repentance rather than
   retaliating unethically. When outcomes fall short of expectations,
   document your experience, learn from mistakes, and reflect on how to
   improve.

-  **Diligence:** Practice your craft consistently, regularly review
   your work, and continuously seek improvement. Engage actively with
   your professional community to both learn and teach.

-  **Charity:** Be generous with your time, attention, and care toward
   those who are disadvantaged. Adjust fees or support others where
   circumstances allow. Never let financial reward tempt you into
   shortcuts or compromise the quality and reliability of your work

-  **Temperance:** Exercise moderation in your use of resources, time,
   and effort. Keep work simple and efficient, but do not compromise
   safety, quality, or the interests of those you serve.

-  **Chastity:** Maintain professional boundaries and decorum. Never
   exploit the vulnerable or those who trust you. Ensure your decisions
   are fair and impartial.

-  **Courage:** Uphold professional standards and ethical principles,
   even in the face of coercion or threats from those in positions of
   greater power.

-  **Integrity:** Teach your craft and ethical conduct by example, and
   follow the rules you expect others to respect.
