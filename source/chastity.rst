   and desires so they remain aligned with love and dignity.

   reducing a person to an object of use.

   commitments, and responsibilities.

   authentic self-giving.

 Lust

Lust is the vice of excessive desire for sexual pleasure, sought apart
from love, fidelity, or respect. It distorts the gift of sexuality by
reducing others to objects of gratification, placing passion above
reason, and dignity.

Key Characteristics:

-  **Excessive Desire:** Pursuing gratification without moderation or
   rightful boundaries.
-  **Objectification:** Treating others as means of pleasure rather than
   as persons of dignity and worth.
-  **Loss of self-mastery:** Allowing passion to overpower reason,
   conscience, and commitment.
-  **Infidelity:** Disregarding vows, trust, or loyalty in pursuit of
   desire.

Some of these thoughts might lead you to believe lust is justified.
Here, there are some arguments for reflection and reconsideration.

-  **"It’s natural, so it’s fine to give in."** *Invitation:* Desire is
   natural, but not all natural impulses are meant to be indulged
   without limit. Chastity directs desire toward respect, intimacy, and
   love rather than mere impulse.

-  **"I’m not hurting anyone."** *Invitation:* Lust often reduces others
   to objects. This erodes your ability to honor real relationships with
   dignity and mutual respect.

-  **"I can’t control myself."** *Invitation:* While desire feel strong,
   you are not powerless. Each moment of restraint strengthens
   self-mastery.

-  **"Everyone does it."** *Invitation:* Common behavior doesn’t make it
   healthy or noble. Choosing differently sets you apart and shows
   courage to live by values.

-  **"I need this for stress relief."** *Invitation:* Indulgence can
   reduce stress, but relying on lust masks deeper needs for rest,
   connection, or peace. Healthier coping methods build resilience and
   avoid dependence.

-  **"As long as it’s private, it doesn’t matter."** *Invitation:*
   Hidden actions still shape character. Every choice forms habits that
   influence how you view yourself and how you treat others. Integrity
   begins in private.
