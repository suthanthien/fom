 Robert Merton
###############

Robert King Merton (1910–2003) was an American sociologist and one of
the founding figures of modern sociology of science. He spent most of
his career at Columbia University and was deeply influential in shaping
how scholars understand the social structure of science, scientific
knowledge, and professional norms. Merton is especially known for
linking sociology with ethics, focusing not on personal morality but on
the normative framework that governs scientific practice.

Merton’s ethical contributions are primarily embedded in his sociology
of science rather than in traditional moral philosophy.

-  **Science, Technology and Society in Seventeenth-Century England
   (1938):** This early work explored the social and moral conditions
   that enabled the rise of modern science, laying the groundwork for
   his later ethical analysis.

-  **The Normative Structure of Science (1942):** This is Merton’s most
   influential ethical text. In it, he articulated the core ethical
   norms of science, later summarized as CUDOS. This essay became
   foundational for discussions of scientific integrity and research
   ethics.

-  **Priorities in Scientific Discovery (1957):** Merton examined
   ethical issues related to credit, originality, and recognition in
   science, emphasizing fairness and communal responsibility.

-  **The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations
   (1973):** This collection consolidated decades of work on scientific
   norms, deviance, reward systems, and ethical tensions within
   scientific institutions.

Merton’s primary concern is the system through which scientists are
rewarded for their work and how particular reward structures shape
scientific behavior. He argues that certain forms of reward, especially
those tied to ownership, profit, or personal advantage, can create
incentives that undermine the ethical norms of scientific inquiry. In
response, Merton articulates a model in which rewards are based
primarily on recognition by the scientific community. This model does
not eliminate self-interest, but redirects it toward practices that
sustain epistemic reliability and public trust.

Although Merton does not explicitly refer to Ibn al-Haytham, his account
of the scientific ethos expands upon al-Haytham ethical principles,
while transforming them into institutional norms.

-  **Disinterestedness:** Scientists are expected to adopt a stance of
   disinterest toward outcomes. While Ibn al-Haytham frames this as an
   individual discipline, guarding against bias, passion, and
   attachment, Merton recasts it as an institutional norm enforced by
   peer scrutiny and professional sanctions. In both cases, the aim is
   to prevent distortion of results and preserve the credibility of
   scientific claims.

-  **Organized skepticism:** Ibn al-Haytham insists that claims must be
   tested rather than accepted on authority, including one’s own. Merton
   extends this principle into organized skepticism, whereby critical
   scrutiny becomes a collective and systematic practice of the
   scientific community. This institutionalization ensures that
   skepticism is not optional or personal, but a defining feature of
   scientific practice.

-  **Truthfulness in reporting:** Both thinkers emphasize the obligation
   to represent findings accurately and completely. Ibn al-Haytham
   treats truthful reporting as a moral and epistemic duty of the
   individual investigator, necessary for certainty and correction of
   error. Merton incorporates this obligation into the norms of science
   by linking full disclosure to reproducibility, validation, and
   communal evaluation.

Merton then introduces elements that have no clear counterpart in Ibn
al-Haytham’s thought and represent new additions:

-  **Communalism:** Merton articulates the principle of communalism,
   according to which scientific knowledge is regarded as a collective
   product of the scientific community rather than the private property
   of individual researchers. Discoveries are expected to be publicly
   shared rather than withheld, allowing rapid circulation,
   verification, and extension of results.

-  **Recognition:** Merton envisions a system in which scientists are
   rewarded primarily through recognition rather than ownership.
   Priority of discovery and peer esteem provide incentives for
   contribution while preserving open access to knowledge. By decoupling
   reward from exclusive control, this model enables collective
   advancement and accelerates scientific progress.

 Merton's ethical guidelines
*****************************

-  **Treat scientific knowledge as a public good:** Publish results in
   accessible venues whenever possible. Avoid unnecessarily restricting
   access to findings. Frame research questions around collective
   benefit.

-  **Share data, methods, and results openly:** Deposit datasets and
   code in recognized repositories. Provide detailed methods sections
   that enable replication. Respond constructively to reasonable
   requests for data or clarification. Report null and negative results
   honestly. Never alter data to fit hypotheses.

-  **Evaluate claims based on evidence:** Adopt blind peer review
   processes when possible. Separate assessment of ideas from opinions
   about the author. Challenge prestige bias when citing or reviewing
   work.

-  **Disclose conflicts of interest:** Declare financial, institutional,
   or personal conflicts. Update disclosures as circumstances change.
   Recuse yourself from decisions when impartiality is compromised.

-  **Accept scrutiny of your own work:** Invite peer feedback before
   submission. Respond to criticism respectfully and substantively. View
   critique as part of scientific quality control.

-  **Give proper credit:** Use clear authorship criteria from project
   outset. Cite sources thoroughly and fairly. Acknowledge non-author
   contributors explicitly.

-  **Respect priority while recognizing collective discovery:** Avoid
   racing to publish incomplete or unreliable findings. Credit parallel
   or prior work generously. Distinguish clearly between original
   contributions and extensions.

-  **Limit secrecy to ethical necessity:** Justify confidentiality in
   writing when required. Revisit secrecy restrictions periodically.
   Release findings once ethical or legal constraints expire.

-  **Correct errors openly:** Issue corrections or retractions promptly.
   Inform collaborators and journals of discovered mistakes.

-  **Promote equitable collaboration:** Set clear expectations for
   students and junior researchers. Protect academic freedom and credit
   of subordinates. Address grievances without retaliation.

-  **Treat ethics as a professional obligation:** Engage in regular
   ethics training. Discuss ethical dilemmas openly in labs and teams.
   Recognize that ethical conduct sustains science itself.
