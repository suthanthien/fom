 Jean-Paul Sartre
##################

Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) was a French philosopher, novelist,
playwright, and public intellectual, best known as the leading figure of
existentialism. He lived through major political upheavals of the 20th
century: World War II, the Nazi occupation of France, decolonization,
and the Cold War. He consistently viewed philosophy as inseparable from
lived experience and political engagement. Sartre refused the Nobel
Prize in Literature in 1964, arguing that writers should not allow
themselves to be institutionalized.

Although Sartre never produced a systematic ethical treatise, ethical
questions are central to his philosophical and literary work.

-  **Being and Nothingness (1943):** Sartre’s major philosophical work.
   While primarily ontological, it lays the foundation for his ethics
   through concepts such as freedom, responsibility, bad faith, and
   authenticity.

-  **Existentialism Is a Humanism (1946):** A public lecture defending
   existentialism against critics; this text offers Sartre’s clearest
   and most accessible ethical claims.

-  **What Is Literature? (1947):** A direct engagement with the ethical
   and political responsibility of the writer.

-  **Notebooks for an Ethics (written 1947–1948, published posthumously
   in 1983):** Sartre’s most explicit attempt to formulate an ethics
   grounded in freedom, though unfinished.

-  **Plays and novels,** such as No Exit (1944), Dirty Hands (1948), and
   The Roads to Freedom trilogy (1945–1949) dramatize ethical conflict,
   responsibility, and choice.

****************************
 Existential responsibility
****************************

Sartre argues that human beings are **wholly responsible** for what they
do and for what they become through their actions. Even when individuals
choose inaction, or simply conform to the norms of the community to
which they belong, they remain responsible for that choice. There is no
escape from responsibility. Each day calls for a moral decision: how
will one spend the day? How will one affect others? Will one allow
events to unfold passively, or will one attempt to intervene and shape
them?

Sartre’s work is a provocation to the human conscience, an attempt to
awaken the moral foundations upon which everyday life rests. We often
rely on moral rules inherited from tradition, but how often do we pause
to examine them and genuinely make them our own? Sartre criticizes
institutionalized moral values not because they are necessarily wrong,
but because they can encourage passivity: acting simply because “this is
what is done.” He calls this attitude **bad faith**: living according to
borrowed beliefs rather than one’s own convictions.

Sartre invites us to take a courageous stance: to shape our values and
live in accordance with them, even in the face of risk and uncertainty.
He calls us to engage fully with life: to act, to participate in
society, and to bring forth what is meaningful. This does not require
rejecting existing moral frameworks. One may find that established
systems of ethics, philosophy, or spirituality align with one’s own
commitments. What matters, however, is that this **alignment is
consciously chosen and continually reaffirmed**. It must reflect one’s
own will, not mere compliance with an external authority or inherited
convention.

In this respect, Sartre’s account resonates with Kant and Aristotle in
that all three locate the source of morality within the human agent.
Kant and Aristotle appeal to reason as the foundation for determining
what is morally right, while Sartre emphasizes that each individual must
take responsibility for their choices and commit to their values. He
does not reject reason or rational reflection; rather, he insists that
moral frameworks, including Kantian and Aristotelian ones, must be
actively appropriated and lived authentically. In other words, one may
adopt these principles, but only as a result of one’s own **reflective
commitment**, not simply because they are authoritative or widely
accepted.

This perspective also resonates with al-Ghazālī’s call for inward
reflection. While al-Ghazālī invites the seeker to discover God as a
being with defined attributes, Sartre begins from the absence of any
predefined authority. In Sartre’s view, there are no external
guarantees, and values must be assumed and reaffirmed by the individual.
Yet both thinkers converge in their ethical demand: human beings are
called to examine themselves, commit to what is meaningful, and take
responsibility for their choices. Sartre acknowledges that this
condition can feel difficult or even unhappy, because the search for
meaning or transcendence cannot be guaranteed. Still, he insists that
individuals must assume responsibility for shaping their lives and for
**living sincerely** in accordance with what they find significant. What
matters is not whether one discovers God or adheres to a particular
metaphysical framework, but that one acts authentically and avoids
living in bad faith.

If a person reflects carefully and employs reason, they may arrive at
Aristotle’s ethics or Kant’s categorical imperative. If they turn inward
in pursuit of moral or spiritual refinement, they may encounter God or
divine principles, as al-Ghazālī suggests. Others may be drawn to ethics
of care, such as Lindemann’s approach, or to relational frameworks like
Mbiti’s or Mogobe Ramose’s ubuntu. One may also integrate multiple
traditions, adding a personal perspective and shaping a coherent moral
outlook. What is essential, from a Sartrean perspective, is not which
framework is chosen, but that one acts consciously and responsibly:
refusing to follow rules or traditions unthinkingly. The call is to be
courageous, to **embrace responsibility**, and to shape one’s life
through reflective, committed action.

Ultimately, Sartre’s critique is directed at the **teachers of
morality**: those who present moral foundations as absolute and
unquestionable; those who invite obedience without reflection; those who
expect their words to be followed uncritically. He challenges those who
teach morality through compliance while lacking genuine understanding
themselves, thereby passing conformity on to their students. Such
teachers have forgotten the principles they claim to uphold and no
longer act with practical wisdom. Sartre concedes that students may
listen to moral authorities, but in the end, he makes them aware that
action or inaction remains the students' moral responsibility.

*********************
 Existential courage
*********************

Sartre and other existential thinkers treat courage as a mode of acting:
the willingness to commit oneself through action in the face of
uncertainty, risk, and the absence of guarantees. Courage, in this
sense, consists in **acting in alignment with what one takes to be
meaningful**, even when one’s understanding is incomplete and the
outcome unclear. What distinguishes this existential account from
classical virtue ethics is that there is no requirement that practical
wisdom be fully developed prior to action.

In classical virtue ethics, courage is admirable in part because it is
exercised with discernment, shaped by experience, and integrated into a
broader structure of character and practical wisdom. By contrast,
existential accounts emphasize the irreducible urgency of action:
individuals are always already called upon to choose and to act, even
when they lack sufficient knowledge, experience, or moral certainty. The
absence of full practical wisdom does not excuse inaction, because not
acting is itself a choice for which one remains responsible.

Recognizing something as significant or worth pursuing is sufficient,
from an existential perspective, to justify commitment. It is through
such commitments that moral insight and practical understanding are
gradually formed. Reflection alone cannot generate wisdom; **practical
wisdom develops through engagement**, through acting, responding,
revising, and taking responsibility for the consequences of one’s
choices. Where moral education emphasizes obedience or rule-following
without personal appropriation, genuine practical wisdom cannot emerge.

Rather than opposing virtue ethics, the existential understanding of
courage can be seen as addressing a formative dimension of moral life:
the stage at which individuals must act responsibly before stable
virtues or reliable judgment have taken shape. Through repeated acts of
commitment, accompanied by reflection and self-critique, patterns of
action may emerge that resemble what virtue ethics later describes as
character. In this sense, existential courage precedes and enables the
development of practical wisdom and virtuous courage.

Although Sartre rejects the idea that possessing a virtuous character
trait can by itself guarantee moral action, he acknowledges that
sustained engagement in responsible action can cultivate durable forms
of understanding and responsiveness. Courage, understood existentially,
is thus both **the exercise of freedom and the practice through which
one learns how to live it**. By acting, committing, and assuming
responsibility in situations of uncertainty, individuals continually
bring their moral lives into being.

 Sartre's ethical guidelines
*****************************

-  **Take full responsibility for your actions** Recognize that every
   choice is yours, even when it seems constrained by social norms,
   roles, or circumstances. Avoid blaming external authorities, rules,
   or “fate” for your decisions. Pause before acting to ask: Am I
   choosing this freely, or am I hiding behind someone else’s standard?

-  **Reflect consciously on your values:** Identify what matters most to
   you in life through introspection. Question inherited or culturally
   imposed norms to see whether they align with your authentic values.
   Write down or articulate your values clearly to make them explicit.

-  **Choose and reaffirm your commitments actively:** Once you identify
   a value, commit to it deliberately in concrete situations. Reassess
   and reaffirm your commitments regularly to ensure they remain
   genuine. Resist following rules or traditions blindly: alignment with
   your chosen values must be intentional.

-  **Act courageously in alignment with your values:** Take action even
   when outcomes are uncertain or risky. Step outside comfort zones to
   engage with situations that challenge your integrity.

-  **Engage in reflective practice and moral learning:** Treat each
   action as an opportunity to learn about yourself and refine your
   values. Develop “practical insight” through repeated reflection and
   conscious action.

-  **Respect the freedom of others:** Recognize that others are also
   free agents responsible for their own choices. Avoid imposing your
   values on others as absolutes; encourage dialogue and mutual
   understanding. Take into account how your actions affect others.
