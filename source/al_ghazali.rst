 Al-Ghazālī
############

Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazālī (1058–1111 CE) was a Persian
Muslim theologian, jurist, philosopher, and mystic. Born in Tus (in
modern-day Iran), Al-Ghazali became one of the most influential figures
in Islamic intellectual history. He served as a professor at the
Nizamiyya College in Baghdad before undergoing a spiritual crisis that
led him to abandon his post in 1095 and devote himself to a life of
asceticism and contemplation.

Some of the most important include:

-  **The Revival of the Religious Sciences (1100 CE):** this monumental
   work combines jurisprudence, theology, and mysticism. Its second
   quarter, “The Norms of Daily Life” and “The Destructive Evils and the
   Saving Virtues,” deals directly with ethical conduct, purification of
   the soul, and moral psychology.

-  **The Balance of Action (1094 CE):** this treatise provides a
   systematic account of moral reasoning and virtue, examining the
   relation between knowledge, intention, and moral worth.

-  **The Alchemy of Happiness (1105 CE):** it summarizes the essence of
   the "revival" in a more accessible form, emphasizing the moral
   transformation of the soul through self-knowledge and devotion.

***********************
 Spiritual fulfillment
***********************

Spiritual fulfillment, for Al-Ghazālī, is a state of enduring happiness
that transcends the impermanence of worldly conditions. He describes it
as the union of the soul with God, a state in which the heart reflects
divine light and the soul is purified of base desires. This state is
characterized by:

-  **Self-knowledge:** a deep awareness of one’s own intentions,
   motivations, and moral disposition.

-  **Self-mastery:** the alignment of actions with virtuous intentions,
   and consistency between inner resolve and outward behavior.

-  **Virtue:** the habitual cultivation of moral excellence, which
   gradually cleanses the soul of cravings and shapes it to reflect the
   divine moral attributes.

-  **Devotion** the recognition that humans are not self-sufficient and
   depend on God. Devotion is an aspiration to imitate God’s moral
   qualities, but never His essence or omnipotence.

Those who attain spiritual fulfillment display the following qualities:

-  Peace and contentment in all circumstances.
-  Detachment from greed, worldly praise, and transient desires.
-  Compassion and forgiveness toward others.
-  Spontaneous delight in what is good and aversion to what is evil.
-  Continuous remembrance of God and conscious acceptance of human
   dependence on Him.

Structurally, some parallels can be drawn between Al-Ghazālī and Western
philosophers:

-  Like Kant, Al-Ghazālī emphasizes that the moral value of action
   depends on intention. For Kant, this follows from reason and duty;
   for Al-Ghazālī, it is a necessary condition for spiritual happiness
   and the purification of the soul.

-  Like Aristotle, he highlights the importance of balance in character
   traits. Moral virtue lies in the mean between extremes, and a healthy
   soul requires courage, temperance, and practical wisdom, though for
   Al-Ghazālī, these virtues are not only rational but oriented toward
   union with God.

**********************
 Path to purification
**********************

Al-Ghazālī also agrees with Thomas Aquinas that reason alone is
insufficient to acquire knowledge of God. However, while Aquinas
emphasizes the role of grace bestowed externally, Al-Ghazālī emphasizes
**turning inward**. By examining the self and purifying the heart, one
comes to experience God directly within. He outlines a structured path
of spiritual purification that anyone can follow:

-  **Self-knowledge:** The first step is sincere introspection,
   observing one’s intentions without deception. Because intentions are
   known only to oneself and God, honest reflection allows a person to
   understand how God perceives their inner state.

-  **Discipline:** The second step involves cultivating moral behavior
   as a form of training. Repeated practice of restraint, humility, and
   accuracy in speech strengthens the soul, preparing it for
   circumstances that test virtue. Examples include fasting, acts of
   service, humility, and keeping the company of virtuous people.

-  **Repentance:** The third step is recognizing past faults and
   unvirtuous intentions, feeling sincere remorse, and resolving not to
   repeat these errors.

-  **Sincerity:** The fourth step is purifying one’s actions so that all
   deeds are performed solely out of love for God, aligning the soul
   with the moral ideal it aspires to become.

-  **Remembrance:** Next, one cultivates constant awareness of God,
   acknowledging that all good intentions and actions ultimately
   originate from divine guidance.

-  **Love:** The culmination of this path is the experience of love and
   spiritual fulfillment: joy in moral action for its own sake, and
   inner perception of God's presence.

***********
 Sincerity
***********

Sincerity is the virtue of performing good actions for their own sake,
without any secondary aim, whether material, psychological, or even the
desire for praise and approval. In al-Ghazālī’s view, virtuous actions
are undertaken because they purify the heart and draw a person closer to
God, who embodies these virtues in their perfection.

Al-Ghazālī’s ideas resonate in certain respects with those of Aristotle.
For Aristotle, flourishing is a state in which actions and desires are
harmonized, and in which a person finds joy in virtuous action for its
own sake. Al-Ghazālī likewise emphasizes the alignment of intention and
action, though he locates the ultimate end not in human nature itself
but in devotion to God. Whereas Aristotle’s eudaimonia renders humanity
self-sufficient, al-Ghazālī’s spiritual fulfillment leads a person to
recognize human dependence on God.

Al-Ghazālī would also share ethical affinities with Śāntideva. Since God
is infinite compassion, a sincere person seeks to embody compassion for
its own sake. A compassionate individual genuinely desires to relieve
the suffering of others and acts accordingly. Both thinkers agree that
true spiritual development requires cultivating compassion and wisdom
for the benefit of others.

Al-Ghazālī would also share ethical affinities with Mogobe Ramose. Since
God is infinite mercy, a sincere person seeks to embody mercy for its
own sake. A merciful individual genuinely desires to give others the
opportunity to redeem themselves from wrongdoing and therefore seeks
restorative justice. Both thinkers agree that true spiritual development
requires cultivating forgiveness in order to preserve the wholeness of
the community.

************
 Traditions
************

Al-Ghazālī gives philosophical foundation to the tradition of the
Islamic community, by showing how they naturally arise from lived
experience guided by introspection and purification. These traditions
included:

-  **Belief in God** and recognition of His key attributes: God is
   all-knowing, omnipotent, infinitely compassionate and merciful, and
   acts with perfect justice.

   spiritual discipline, remembrance of God, and alignment of the heart
   with divine will.

   strengthens self-control, and heightens awareness of God.

   and unity within the Muslim community.

-  **Remembrance:** Regular contemplation and invocation of God’s names
   and attributes to cultivate awareness, gratitude, and connection with

-  **Repentance:** Sincerely acknowledging one’s faults, seeking
   forgiveness, and resolving to improve, as a continual process of
   moral and spiritual refinement.

   obligations to reinforce moral behavior and spiritual development.

*********************************
 Al-Ghazali's ethical guidelines
*********************************

These are practical Guidelines from Al-Ghazali’s Moral Teachings:

-  **Purify intentions:** Before every action, prayer, study, work, or
   charity, pause briefly to recall why you are doing it. Ask yourself:
   “Is this for my ego or for love of virtue?” Renew your intention
   daily, especially when routine makes acts mechanical. Avoid seeking
   praise or recognition for good deeds.

-  **Develop self-Knowledge:** Reflect regularly on your motives and
   emotions. Keep a “moral diary” to track anger, jealousy, or pride.
   Read spiritual texts that reveal inner states of the soul. Seek
   solitude for honest self-reflection.

-  **Control the passions:** Eat and sleep in moderation. Guard your
   tongue from harsh words or gossip. When anger arises, remain silent
   and perform ablution. Train your will through fasting or voluntary
   restraint.

-  **Seek balance and Moderation:** Avoid extremes, whether in speech,
   spending, or emotions. Before reacting, ask: “Am I overdoing or
   neglecting this?” Keep a balanced schedule of worship, work, rest,
   and social duty. Learn from the Prophet’s example of measured living.

-  **Practice repentance:** Acknowledge sins without excuses. Feel
   genuine remorse, and sorrow for offending God. Resolve never to
   repeat the wrong. Follow repentance with good deeds to cleanse the
   heart.

-  **Aspire to sincerity:** Hide voluntary acts of charity or worship
   when possible. Examine your heart after praise, are you pleased
   because others noticed? If pride appears, remind yourself that all
   good comes from God. Seek anonymity in service whenever you can.

-  **Practice gratitude and patience:** Each morning, recall three
   blessings and give thanks. When facing difficulty, remember it is a
   test and opportunity for growth. Express gratitude to people,
   thanking them is part of thanking God.

-  **Humility:** Acknowledge your dependence on God in success. Listen
   attentively to others, especially those of lower status. Accept
   correction without resentment. Perform small, humble acts, like
   serving food or cleaning your space.

-  **Love of God:** Cultivate love through worship, recitation, and
   contemplation of creation. Reflect on God’s mercy and blessings to
   kindle affection. Replace resentment or envy with love for God’s will
   in all things. Make acts of kindness an expression of love for the
   Creator.

-  **Service to Others:** Offer help quietly without expecting return.
   Show compassion to the poor, sick, and lonely. Be just and honest in
   all dealings. Speak gently and forgive others’ faults.

-  **Knowledge as a Moral Duty:** Study religious and moral knowledge
   regularly. Learn not only “what” to do but “why” it is right. Apply
   every lesson to action: knowledge without practice is like a tree
   without fruit. Seek teachers and companions who inspire both wisdom
   and humility.
