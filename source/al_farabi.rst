 Al-Farābī
###########

Abū Naṣr al-Farābī (c. 872–950 CE) was one of the most influential
philosophers of the classical Islamic world and is often called “the
Second Teacher”, after Aristotle. Born in Farab (in present-day
Kazakhstan), al-Farabi lived and taught in major intellectual centers
such as Baghdad, Aleppo, and Damascus. His work synthesized Greek
philosophy with Islamic thought.

While al-Farabi wrote on logic, metaphysics, political philosophy,
psychology, and music, his ethical thought is inseparable from his
political philosophy, especially his concern with leadership,
governance, and the moral purpose of the state.

Al-Farābī did not write a single standalone “ethics” treatise in the
modern sense; instead, his ethical views are embedded within his
political and philosophical works:

-  **Opinions of the People of the Virtuous City (942–945 CE):** His
   most important ethical–political work, describing the moral structure
   of society and the qualities of the ideal ruler.

-  **The Attainment of Happiness (930–940 CE):** Explores human
   happiness as the ultimate ethical goal, achievable through virtue and
   intellect.

-  **Civil Politics: (940 CE):** Discusses governance, leadership, and
   moral education within the state.

-  **Aphorisms of the Statesman (940–950 CE):** A concise ethical and
   political guide for rulers and administrators.

 Principles of governance
**************************

In a manner similar to Aristotle’s functional argument, Al-Farābī
maintains that human beings ultimately seek happiness, understood as the
perfection of their distinctive rational capacities. While pleasure is
commonly pursued, it is unstable and its pursuit is shared with
non-rational animals. What distinguishes human beings is their capacity
for intellect and reason. True happiness, for Al-Farābī, lies in the
full actualization of these capacities, culminating in intellectual
perfection. A moral life is therefore one oriented toward the
**cultivation of the intellect** and the apprehension of truth.

While Aristotle’s ethical framework allows, in principle, for anyone
with rational capacity to cultivate both **moral and intellectual
virtues**, Al-Farābī believes that humans differ in their capacity for
abstract reasoning, which leads to distinct forms of virtue and
flourishing. He does not investigate the source of this limitation,
whether it arises from innate intellectual differences, access to
education, or other factors. He simply observes that many people lack
the ability to reason abstractly and treats this as a given.
Accordingly, he assumes that only a small minority can grasp
philosophical principles directly, and that philosophical education,
which is necessary for abstract reasoning, should be reserved for these
few. Al-Farābī does not consider that limited access to education might
itself account for these differences in intellectual capability.

Like Maimonides, Al-Farābī observes that intellectual perfection does
not arise in isolation. Human beings require a stable **political and
social order** in which learning and moral formation can take place. For
Al-Farābī, the primary purpose of political association is to establish
laws and institutions that guide citizens toward virtue and cultivate
their intellectual capacities. Unlike Maimonides, however, he holds that
humans differ in their abilities, and accordingly can aspire to
different levels of moral development; only a few can attain full truth
and moral perfection, while the majority are guided indirectly through
habit, law, and symbolic instruction. Political rule is thus justified
insofar as it promotes the conditions necessary for human flourishing
according to individuals’ capacities.

Governance, according to Al-Farābī, must be grounded in reason rather
than emotion. Short-term desires often conflict with the long-term good
of the community, and only **rational deliberation** can discern the
means by which true happiness may be approximated within political life.
When rulers act on impulse rather than knowledge, their authority
becomes arbitrary, undermining order and the educative function of law.
Such misrule leads to the deterioration of civic life and frustrates the
city’s orientation toward virtue.

For Al-Farābī, good rulership is characterized by the following
qualities:

-  **Moral exemplarity:** The ruler sets the ethical standard of the
   community. Because citizens tend to imitate those in authority, a
   virtuous ruler reinforces good customs and laws, whereas a corrupt
   ruler weakens them, allowing vice to permeate institutions,
   education, and social practice.

-  **Intellectual excellence:** Human beings differ in knowledge and
   capacity, and political authority must therefore belong to those who
   possess superior intellectual insight. Only rulers who have
   undertaken philosophical education are qualified to legislate and
   govern in accordance with justice and the true good.

The purpose of rulership and political life, for Al-Farābī, is to
promote:

-  **Harmony within the city:** Individuals are assigned roles according
   to their natural abilities and dispositions. This ordered
   differentiation enables justice and supports the moral development of
   the soul.

-  **Cooperation:** No individual can attain material self-sufficiency
   or moral and intellectual perfection alone. Cooperative life within
   the city is therefore necessary for the pursuit of happiness.

-  **Education:** Professional training ensures that the material needs
   of the city are met, while moral and intellectual education directs
   citizens toward virtue. For those unable to reach deeper
   philosophical understanding, religion serves as an imaginative and
   symbolic representation of philosophical truths, guiding conduct and
   belief in a manner suited to their capacities.

Finally, Al-Farābī holds that rulers bear a **heightened moral
responsibility**, since their decisions shape the character and
direction of the entire political community. The ruler owes the
community careful and informed decision-making, along with efforts to
define the best policies and establish institutions that promote the
virtuous development of its members toward happiness.

 Philosophical guidance
************************

Unlike Aristotle’s virtue ethics, which offers detailed guidance for
individual moral development, Al-Farābī addresses ethical practice
primarily at the level of political and educational structures rather
than personal self-cultivation. His guidance is directed toward rulers
and lawgivers, whose task is to shape laws, education, and institutions
that regulate behavior, habituate virtue, and orient citizens toward the
good.

Education provides the core medium of practical instruction. Al-Farābī
emphasizes differentiated pedagogical methods according to natural
capacities: philosophical demonstration is reserved for a few, while the
majority are guided through imitation, persuasion, and symbolic
representation.

Al-Farābī’s treatise functions as part of the ruler’s education,
providing the framework, principles, and classifications necessary to
understand human flourishing and the moral development of the city.
However, **Al-Farābī’s treatise is not intended to offer complete,
step-by-step instructions.** A ruler's intellectual development is
supplemented by other forms of education, such discussion with advisors
and the ruler’s own experience.

********************************
 Al-Farābī's ethical guidelines
********************************

-  **Aim all actions at true happiness:** Focus on decisions that
   promote long-term human flourishing. Evaluate the impact of actions
   on moral, intellectual, and social well-being, and reflect on whether
   they contribute to meaningful human development.

   consistent practice of honesty, fairness, and responsibility. Seek
   opportunities for learning and ethical growth, and integrate virtues
   into daily routines and decision-making.

   biases and self-interest before making important choices. Reflect,
   deliberate, and seek insight to ensure decisions align with long-term
   ethical and civic goals.

-  **Base leadership on knowledge and understanding:** Prioritize
   learning, reflection, and sound judgment in decision-making. Seek
   guidance and insight where necessary, and acknowledge the limits of

-  **Practice justice as harmony:** Promote fairness and balance in
   assigning roles, responsibilities, and resources. Encourage
   consistent application of rules and principles to maintain order and
   ethical coherence.

-  **Use law and policy to shape moral development:** Design rules,
   regulations, and initiatives that encourage ethical behavior and
   social trust. Consider the long-term effects of policies on character
   and civic life.

-  **Lead by ethical example:** Demonstrate integrity, honesty, and
   commitment to ethical principles in all actions. Recognize that
   personal conduct sets a standard that influences the broader
