 Niccolò Machiavelli
#####################

Niccolò Machiavelli (1469–1527) was an Italian political thinker,
diplomat, historian, and public official of the Florentine Republic
during the Renaissance. He lived in a period marked by political
instability, foreign invasions, and the fragmentation of Italy into
competing city-states. Machiavelli served as a senior civil servant and
diplomat from 1498 to 1512, gaining first-hand experience in statecraft,
war, and diplomacy.

After the Medici family returned to power in Florence in 1512,
Machiavelli was dismissed, briefly imprisoned, and later retired to
private life. It was during this period of political exile that he wrote
his most influential works.

Although Machiavelli did not write a formal ethical treatise, his
ethical ideas are embedded in his political works:

-  **The Prince (written 1513; published 1532):** His most famous work,
   focused on how rulers acquire, maintain, and consolidate power. It
   offers a pragmatic, results-oriented view of political morality.

-  **Discourses on Livy (written c. 1513–1519; published 1531):** A
   broader and more republican work, analyzing political freedom,
   institutions, and civic virtue, drawing lessons from ancient Rome.

-  **The History of Florence (completed 1525):** A historical analysis
   emphasizing power struggles, factionalism, and political realism.

-  **Plays and Letters (notably The Mandrake, 1518):** These works
   further illustrate his views on human nature, deception, and social
   norms.

******************
 State governance
******************

Machiavelli presents rulers as responsible for **maintaining a free and
stable society, governing effectively and preserving authority**. In
practice, these responsibilities are inseparable, since each depends on
the others:

-  only a stable society can sustain a functioning economy, provide
   reliable taxation, and remain prepared to defend against external
   threats; only a free society allows the ruler to exercise authority
   without constant challenge or compromise.

-  rulers therefore act as guarantors of freedom and stability, applying
   their knowledge of diplomacy and statecraft, and modeling disciplined
   conduct.

Machiavelli observes that unwavering adherence to traditional Christian
moral conduct in all circumstances can be dangerous for the survival of
the state. Political life, he argues, is populated by immoral actors,
and rigid commitment to moral ideals exposes a ruler to deception,
manipulation, and eventual deposition. When this occurs, the freedom of
the state is lost, and the ruler has failed in his fundamental mission.
For this reason, a ruler must cultivate **practical wisdom**, learning
when to act in accordance with Christian virtues and when circumstances
require different forms of action.

Machiavelli nonetheless recognizes the value of Christian virtues,
particularly as standards of conduct that support social stability,
economic life, and the general well-being of the people. He therefore
encourages rulers to display such virtues and to **serve as visible
models** of them. By doing so, rulers show trustworthiness and
demonstrate their concern for the welfare of the entire community.
Although Machiavelli emphasizes the political importance of appearing
virtuous, he does not explicitly advocate either a feigned appearance or
a genuinely virtuous one. However, since appearing virtuous is easier
and more effective when a ruler’s private disposition aligns with that
appearance, and since Machivelli prizes actions that enhance a ruler’s
effectiveness, it is reasonable to infer that the cultivation of genuine
virtues is preferable.

However, Machiavelli argues that the unconditional and inflexible
practice of Christian virtues is politically dangerous. Circumstances
may arise in which a ruler must act swiftly in ways that seem, at first
glance, contrary to Christian teachings. A ruler who hesitates too long
in evaluating moral considerations risks losing the opportunity to act
decisively when action is most needed. For this reason, Machiavelli
proposes that Christian virtues be complemented by a distinct set of
**political virtues**:

-  **Courage:** the ability to act in defense of the freedom of the
   state despite personal risk;
-  **Intelligence:** the capacity to anticipate the consequences of
   one’s actions with accuracy;
-  **Adaptability:** the ability to change course when a chosen strategy
   proves ineffective;
-  **Decisiveness:** the ability to take firm decisions and uphold them
   until they achieve their purpose or are shown to be ineffective.

Machiavelli holds that rulers bear a **heightened responsibility** for
the moral and political order of the state. A ruler’s failure to act can
produce instability, which in turn destroys laws, livelihoods, and even
the conditions that allow moral life to be practiced at all. By applying
appropriate incentives at the right moment, even when severe, a ruler
may prevent far greater disorder and suffering. Any pain inflicted is
thus a lesser evil, justified by the prevention of more widespread harm.

In a manner similar to Sun Tzu, Machiavelli ultimately advocates for the
**limitation of suffering**. When alternatives exist, peaceful and
morally acceptable courses of action should be preferred. However, a
ruler must not allow the aspiration to moral purity to obscure political
judgment. When violent or harsh measures become unavoidable, they should
be swift, decisive, and proportionate to the danger faced. Likewise,
when political adversaries rely on deception and manipulation, even in
diplomacy, a ruler may need to conduct negotiations with the same
caution and resolve required in war.

Finally, Machiavelli maintains that it is better for a ruler to be
revered for the ability to uphold justice than to be loved for the
display of moral virtues. **Reverence** is more stable, as it lies
largely within the ruler’s control through the exercise of power, the
administration of laws, and the defense of the state. Love, by contrast,
depends primarily on the dispositions of others. Nevertheless,
Machiavelli warns that reverence must never turn into hatred. If a ruler
exercises power capriciously, unjustly, or for personal ends rather than
the well-being of the people, resentment and oppression will arise,
undermining social stability and ultimately depriving the ruler of the
capacity to govern.

*********
 Virtues
*********

Although Machiavelli warns against rigid adherence to Christian moral
ideals, he nevertheless endorses several virtues traditionally
associated with them, insofar as they contribute to effective rule and
the preservation of the state.

-  **Patience:** A ruler should not act impulsively or be governed by
   emotion. Decisions must be deliberate and calculated, always directed
   toward maintaining political order and the stability of the state.

-  **Diligence:** A ruler must actively administer public affairs,
   closely observe other states, engage continuously in diplomacy, and
   perform the ongoing labor required to secure and preserve power.

-  **Temperance:** A ruler should exercise moderation in the use of
   public resources, deploying them only when such use serves the
   security and endurance of the state. Excessive luxury and
   self-indulgence weaken judgment and invite public resentment.

Other Christian virtues remain worthy of affirmation, yet Machiavelli
holds that they cannot be allowed to dictate political conduct. Their
exercise must remain subordinate to necessity:

-  **Kindness:** A ruler should care for the people and seek their
   security and prosperity, recognizing that stable government
   ultimately serves their well-being. Nonetheless, circumstances may
   arise in which firm or even harsh measures are required to preserve
   order, even if such actions momentarily appear unkind.

-  **Charity:** Generosity toward worthy causes and public goods can
   promote social cohesion and legitimacy. However, a ruler must avoid
   habitual or ostentatious liberality financed by public resources,
   which leads to financial strain and resentment. Charity must
   therefore be practiced with discretion and restraint.

-  **Chastity:** Restraint in private conduct reflects discipline and
   self-mastery. By avoiding public scandal, a ruler preserves dignity,
   prevents contempt, and reduces vulnerability to manipulation:
   conditions essential for stable authority.

-  **Humility:** A ruler may sincerely acknowledge the moral limits of
   human power and the higher order within which political authority
   operates. Yet humility must never take the form of passivity or
   self-abasement. When necessity demands, the ruler must act decisively
   to preserve power and the state, without drawing attention to the
   moral tension such action entails.

 Machiavelli's ethical guidelines
**********************************

-  **Preserve the state as the highest moral duty:** Place institutional
   continuity above personal popularity. Safeguard constitutional order,
   public authority, and security, especially in times of crisis. Accept
   unpopular decisions when they are necessary to prevent collapse or
   disorder.

-  **Base decisions on lessons learned from political history:** Act on
   the assumption of the presence of self-interest, ambition, and
   opportunism among political actors. Design institutions and policies
   with safeguards against corruption and betrayal. Test loyalty through
   observable actions.

-  **Judge policies by their outcomes:** Evaluate decisions according to
   their concrete political and social effects. Abandon policies that
   are morally appealing but practically ineffective. Reward results
   within governance.

-  **Balance mercy with practical wisdom:** Combine clemency with
   credible enforcement. Do not excuse actions that undermine authority
   or public order. Use mercy strategically to consolidate loyalty, but
   act decisively in emergencies. Allow for ethical exceptions when
   necessity demands flexibility.

-  **Safeguard citizens:** Enforce laws consistently and predictably.
   Avoid arbitrary, humiliating, or capricious treatment. Protect
   property, family life, and personal security.

-  **Adapt continuously to changing circumstances:** Closely monitor
   political, social, and economic conditions. Adjust leadership style
   to periods of crisis or stability. Foster adaptability and
   responsiveness within administrative institutions.

-  **Model virtuous conduct publicly:** Communicate decisions using
   shared moral language and public values. Support visible acts of
   justice, legality, and civic responsibility. Preserve public trust
   through symbolic and exemplary leadership.

-  **Accept responsibility for difficult decisions:** Do not shift blame
   onto advisors or subordinates in public. Assume responsibility for
   outcomes, whether successful or not. Protect institutional legitimacy
   by absorbing criticism personally.

-  **Ensure laws are enforced effectively:** Strengthen enforcement
   mechanisms and judicial institutions. Avoid enacting laws without the
   capacity to implement them. Apply rules impartially to prevent the
   erosion of authority.

-  **Minimize harm:** Choose the least damaging option capable of
   achieving political objectives. Avoid unnecessary suffering once
   order has been restored. Terminate exceptional measures promptly when
   stability returns.

-  **Balance honesty with political necessity:** Speak truthfully
   whenever possible, but do not allow candor to endanger the state.
   Avoid unnecessary deception that erodes long-term credibility. When
   promises must be broken or truths concealed, justify such actions
   publicly by reference to necessity and changed circumstances.

 Interpretation notes
**********************

This account of Machiavelli’s political ethics portrays him as broadly
favourable to genuine virtuous behaviour, allowing departures from
conventional moral conduct only when necessitated by the requirements of
state action. Other interpretations, by contrast, depict Machiavelli as
more sympathetic to non-virtuous behaviour, treating virtue primarily as
something to be adopted in appearance rather than in substance, again on
grounds of political necessity. In truth, Machiavelli is not explicit in
endorsing either position. He writes primarily as a practical manual for
rulers, drawing his conclusions from empirical observation and political
experience rather than from a systematic moral theory.

Nevertheless, there are strong reasons to favour the interpretation that
Machiavelli endorses genuine virtue:

-  Machiavelli continues to advocate forms of Aristotelian virtue: good
   government depends on practical wisdom and on the capacity to choose
   the most appropriate course of action in light of particular
   circumstances;

-  He acknowledges the value of Christian virtue in private life and
   recognises the political usefulness of certain virtues in public
   life;

-  Machiavelli prizes actions that enhance a ruler’s effectiveness; it
   is therefore reasonable to infer that, since the genuine practice of
   virtues enables a ruler to exhibit them convincingly, sincere virtue
   is generally preferable to mere simulation;

-  His principal criticism is not directed at virtue as such, but at
   those forms of Christian teaching that encourage passivity,
   self-denial, and resignation, which he regards as politically
   disabling when applied to the exercise of rule.
