 Yamaga Sokō
#############

Yamaga Sokō (1622–1685) was a Japanese Confucian scholar, military
theorist, and ethical philosopher of the early Edo period. He is best
known as a foundational thinker in the development of samurai ethics and
as a precursor to what later came to be called bushidō. Sokō was
originally trained in Neo-Confucianism, but later rejected it in favor
of what he called “Ancient Learning”: a return to the ethical and
political ideals of classical Chinese texts.

Because of his criticism of official Neo-Confucian orthodoxy, Yamaga was
exiled from Edo in 1666 to Akō domain, where he continued teaching and
writing. His ethical ideas strongly influenced later samurai culture and
thinkers.

Yamaga Sokō did not write a single systematic ethical treatise, but his
ethical philosophy is developed across several works:

-  **Essentials of the Sacred Teaching (1665):** A major ethical and
   philosophical text criticizing Zhu Xi Neo-Confucianism and advocating
   a return to the moral teachings of the Confucian classics.

-  **Essentials of Military Teaching (1668):** Integrates ethics with
   military life, arguing that warriors must cultivate moral virtue, not
   merely martial skill.

-  **Facts of the Imperial Court (1670s):** A historical-ethical work
   emphasizing loyalty to the emperor and moral legitimacy grounded in
   historical truth.

-  **Collected Sayings of Yamaga:** A compilation of lectures and
   aphorisms expressing his ethical views on sincerity, duty, and social
   order.

 Loyalty
*********

Sokō develops an ethical framework for the **role of the samurai in
society**, grounded in Confucian teachings. He observes that every
person has a role, and that society functions harmoniously when
individuals dedicate themselves to fulfilling their responsibilities.
For the samurai, this role is to serve the ruler with loyalty: a
position carrying both greater honor and greater responsibility than
that of those engaged in productive roles. A samurai's duties go beyond
engaging in conflict when necessary; they also provides counsel to the
ruler and serves as exemplar of moral excellence for all society.

Like Confucius, Sokō emphasizes respect for inherited practices, ritual
propriety, and reverence for ancestors. These are not mere formalities;
they are disciplines through which moral character is cultivated. At the
same time, Sokō rejects empty observance: ritual and tradition have
value only when they reflect **righteousness and sincerity**. A samurai
must therefore act consistently with both words and intentions, ensuring
that conduct embodies moral principle rather than mere appearance.

Sokō also places great importance on **history as a source of moral
insight**. By studying historical records, one can discern principles
that endure across dynasties and rulers. These principles are understood
as part of the moral heritage handed down by ancestors and must be
honored. Within this inherited tradition lies practical knowledge of
good governance. History, however, is necessarily incomplete: just as we
receive guidance from those who came before us, we also bear
responsibility for what we pass on. From a Confucian perspective that
Sokō shares, it is a great honor to be remembered by later generations
as an exemplary ancestor who upheld moral order.

This concern with historical judgment illuminates Sokō’s view of ruler
legitimacy. A ruler’s role is to govern well, preserve social harmony,
and leave an enduring moral legacy. Yet rulers are human and fallible,
and the full consequences of their decisions may not be immediately
visible. Legitimacy, then, is not assessed solely by short-term
outcomes, but also by the lasting effects of governance as revealed over
time.

In Sokō’s account, a samurai’s loyalty is owed to the ruler, not as
unquestioning obedience, but as a **commitment to safeguarding the
ruler’s legitimacy** in both the short and long term. A samurai embodies
loyalty by supporting the ruler in righteous decisions and offering
counsel when the ruler risks taking actions that are unjust or harmful
and could compromise legitimacy now or in the future.

Taken together, Sokō’s account of loyalty, remonstration, and historical
judgment implies a practical outcome that he does not state outright:
the samurai function, in effect, as a defense of society and social
order itself. Although Sokō insists that loyalty is owed to the ruler,
the content of that loyalty is defined by righteousness, social harmony,
and the preservation of moral order across time. When a ruler governs
well, service to the ruler and service to society coincide. When a ruler
threatens that order, however, the samurai’s duty of remonstration
requires action oriented not toward the ruler’s immediate will, but
toward the conditions that make legitimate rule possible at all. In this
way, even without explicitly redefining loyalty as allegiance to the
people or to society, Sokō’s framework assigns the samurai the
**practical role of safeguarding the moral and social order** on which
both ruler and polity depend.

***************
 Loyal courage
***************

Sokō regards courage as an essential quality of the samurai, even though
he rarely isolates it as a distinct virtue. Instead, courage is woven
into his account of loyalty itself. The form of loyalty he advocates
often demands greater bravery than physical valor alone, and while he
does not always name it explicitly, its presence is clear.

On the battlefield, loyalty is revealed through **readiness to face
danger** and death in service to one’s lord. Fear of injury or death is
natural, but a samurai is guided more strongly by concern for duty and
righteousness. To abandon one’s duty out of fear is to forfeit the moral
standing that defines the samurai’s place in society. Thus, willingness
to endure hardship and risk is not exceptional heroism but the expected
expression of loyal service.

Yet loyalty does not end with military action. It also demands moral
firmness of a different kind. A samurai must be prepared to **offer
honest counsel to the ruler**, even when such counsel is unwelcome. When
a ruler strays from righteousness, silence born of self-preservation is
itself a failure of loyalty. To remonstrate is dangerous, for it may
bring punishment, loss of status, or public disgrace. Nevertheless, from
Sokō’s perspective, loyalty requires precisely this willingness to
endure personal loss for the sake of rightful rule.

In such moments, **loyalty may appear outwardly as defiance**. The ruler
may interpret frank admonition as disobedience or betrayal. Yet Sokō
understands true loyalty as concern for the ruler’s moral standing and
for the order of society the ruler is charged to uphold. A samurai who
remonstrates does so not against the ruler, but for the ruler, seeking
to prevent actions that would damage the foundations of rule itself.

The worth of such conduct may not be recognized in the moment, nor ever
acknowledged at all. A loyal retainer must accept the possibility of
lasting disgrace, even condemnation that endures beyond their lifetime.
By restraining unjust action, the samurai preserves the present social
order and safeguards the moral inheritance that the ruler will hand down
to future generations. In this way, **loyal courage** consists in acting
righteously despite the appearance of disloyalty and the threat of
perpetual dishonor in service of the ruler’s enduring legitimacy and the
preservation of social order throughout history.

 Sokō's ethical guidelines
***************************

-  **Live according to one’s social role:** Clearly understand your
   responsibilities (profession, family, community). Perform duties
   fully even when unobserved or unrewarded.

-  **Cultivate sincerity:** Speak only what you are prepared to act
   upon. Avoid claiming a virtuous status without private discipline.
   Regularly examine whether your actions reflect your stated values.

-  **Practice loyalty grounded in righteousness:** Support leaders and
   institutions only insofar as they uphold justice. Offer honest
   counsel, even when it risks personal cost. Act upon principled
   loyalty, rather than self-serving compliance.

-  **Maintain moral readiness at all times:** Develop habits of
   discipline and self-control. Anticipate ethical challenges before
   they arise. Keep both mind and body trained for responsibility.

-  **Respect historical and moral precedent:** Study historical cases of
   moral success and failure. Reflect on how past exemplars acted under
   pressure. Apply historical lessons to present-day situations.

-  **Balance civil and martial virtue:** Combine learning with physical
   discipline or practical skills. Avoid becoming either passive and
   scholarly or violent and thoughtless. Train both judgment and
   execution.

-  **Serve the public good:** Make decisions based on long-term social
   impact. Accept personal loss when it preserves justice or stability.
   Avoid exploiting positions of authority for personal advantage.

-  **Practice self-discipline:** Establish daily routines of reflection
   and correction. Accept hardship as a means of moral strengthening.
   Treat small lapses seriously before they grow into major faults.
