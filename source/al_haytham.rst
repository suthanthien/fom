 Ibn al-Haytham
################

Ibn al-Haytham (c. 965–1040 CE) was a polymath born in Basra (modern-day
Iraq) who later worked mainly in Cairo. He is best known as one of the
founders of modern optics and for his monumental Book of Optics, which
profoundly influenced both Islamic and European science. Beyond physics
and mathematics, Ibn al-Haytham also engaged deeply with philosophy,
psychology, epistemology, and ethics.

Ibn al-Haytham did not write a large, systematic ethical compendium
comparable to those of later moral philosophers. Instead, his ethical
views appear in shorter treatises and reflective writings, often closely
tied to his epistemology and view of the scholar’s moral
responsibilities.

-  **Treatise on Ethics (1020–1030 CE):** A short philosophical work,
   discussing moral character, self-control, and the cultivation of
   virtue through reason.

-  **Book of Optics (1027):** Ethic is implicit in the scientific
   methodology. Moral virtues such as honesty, patience, and
   intellectual humility are presented as prerequisites for genuine
   knowledge.

 Scientists
************

For Ibn al-Haytham, the role of the scientist is **the discovery of
truth** through observation, experiment, and demonstration, and the
communication of that discovery in a form that allows it to be examined,
tested, and applied. While Ibn al-Haytham does not explicitly formulate
a social theory of science, the practical orientation of his work
implies that scientific knowledge is meant to be useful and applicable
within society.

To reach reliable conclusions, a scientist must cultivate **ethical
virtues** that safeguard the inquiry from error. Ibn al-Haytham
repeatedly warns that bias, haste, love of one’s own opinions, and the
desire for reputation corrupt judgment. A mind governed by such passions
cannot produce reliable knowledge, just as a faulty instrument cannot
yield accurate measurements.

A scientist must cultivate **intellectual humility**. They should remain
skeptical of their own findings and ideas, treating them as provisional
until established by proof. Experiments should be intentionally designed
to test and potentially disprove one’s hypotheses. The temptation of
fame, especially through the premature announcement of striking results,
must be resisted. Due diligence is required, and findings should be
thoroughly reviewed before being presented as true.

**Patience** is an essential virtue of scientific inquiry. Conversation,
criticism, and intellectual disagreement should be understood as part of
the work of discovering truth. The scientist should not give in to
anger, rivalry, or defensiveness toward their own theories, nor resent
skepticism from others. The scientist should actively seek the scrutiny
of colleagues and invite them to challenge and attempt to refute their
claims.

A scientist must be **truthful and honest** in the representation of
their findings. Observations and results should not be exaggerated or
selectively presented in pursuit of fame, wealth, or approval. Instead,
findings should be reported with precision, so that others may rely on
them in further inquiry or practical applications. Incorrect or
overstated knowledge has the potential to cause harm, misdirect effort,
and waste resources.

A scientist must cultivate **healthy skepticism** toward received
tradition and authority. When encountering claims inherited from earlier
scholars, they should not accept them blindly due to reputation,
coercion, or consensus. Ibn al-Haytham explicitly notes that authorities
often disagree and are subject to error. Their claims must therefore be
examined through reason, observation, and experiment. Competing theories
should be assessed by testing which of them survives empirical scrutiny.

Good intention alone is insufficient for ethical inquiry. A scientist
must also become proficient in their discipline and adopt **correct
methods of investigation**. These methods are characterized by fairness
toward evidence and careful attention to procedure. While the pursuit of
truth remains the guiding aim, the scientist should avoid attachment to
any particular conclusion, recognizing that only what is established by
demonstration can be reliably applied for the benefit of society.

*********************************
 Al-Haytham's ethical guidelines
*********************************

-  **Seek truth above personal or social gain:** Define research
   questions based on genuine knowledge gaps. Decline authorship,
   funding, or recognition that requires compromising accuracy.
   Regularly ask: "Would I reach the same conclusion if no reward
   followed?"

-  **Reject blind authority:** Verify claims from senior scholars or
   prestigious journals by examining evidence directly. Encourage
   critical discussion in labs and classrooms.

-  **Practice intellectual humility:** Explicitly state the limitations
   and uncertainties of your findings. Welcome critique in peer review
   and discussion without defensiveness. Revise or abandon hypotheses
   when evidence contradicts them.

-  **Be an “enemy” of your own assumptions:** Actively design
   experiments that could disprove your hypothesis. Keep a written list
   of assumptions underlying your research. Ask colleagues to critique
   your reasoning.

-  **Ground conclusions in evidence and reason:** Separate data
   presentation from interpretation in papers and reports. Avoid drawing
   conclusions beyond what results justify. Use appropriate statistical
   and methodological tools, and seek help when unsure.

-  **Exercise patience and perseverance:** Allocate sufficient time for
   replication and validation of results. Resist pressure to publish
   prematurely. Treat failed experiments as sources of information.

-  **Maintain honesty in observation and reporting:** Record data
   accurately, including anomalies. Report negative or null results when
   they are relevant. Correct mistakes publicly when discovered.

-  **Separate personal belief from empirical investigation:**
   Distinguish clearly between empirical findings and personal,
   philosophical, or theological views. Let data challenge cherished
   ideas rather than adjusting data to fit them. Use neutral language
   when presenting results that intersect with controversial beliefs.

-  **Pursue balance between reason and emotion:** Pause important
   decisions when emotionally invested or under stress. Use structured
   decision-making tools such as checklists, and peer input. Cultivate
   emotional awareness to prevent bias in interpretation or judgment.

-  **Commit to lifelong learning and refinement:** Regularly update
   skills and knowledge beyond immediate specialization. Reflect on past
   errors as part of ethical growth. Study the philosophy and ethics of
   science alongside technical fields.

-  **Serve society through knowledge:** Communicate research clearly and
   honestly to non-specialists. Prioritize projects that address genuine
   human needs. Mentor younger researchers with integrity, patience, and
   fairness.
